//! This file defines `CallSpan` and `CallSpanStart`,
//! which describe the time that a module spends executing "host calls,"
//! the WASM analog to syscalls.
//!
//! We can collect `CallSpan` timing data for various parts of host-call execution:
//! - `WasmInstanceEnv`, responsible for direct communication between WASM and the host.
//! - `InstanceEnv`, responsible for calls into the relational DB.
//! - Others?
//!
//! The instrumentation has non-negligible overhead,
//! so we enable it on a per-component basis with `cfg` attributes.
//! This is accomplished by defining two interchangeable modules,
//! `noop` and `op`, both of which implement the call-span interface.
//! `noop` does nothing.
//! `op` uses `std::time::Instant` and `std::time::Duration` to capture timings.
//! Components which use the time-span interface will conditionally import one of the two modules, like:
//! ```no-run
//! #[cfg(feature = "spacetimedb-wasm-instance-times)]
//! use instrumentation::op as span;
//! #[cfg(not(feature = "spacetimedb-wasm-instance-times)]
//! use instrumentation::noop as span;
//! ```
