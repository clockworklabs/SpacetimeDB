/// `TxState` tracks all of the modifications made during a particular transaction.
/// Rows inserted during a transaction will be added to insert_tables, and similarly,
/// rows deleted in the transaction will be added to delete_tables.
///
/// Note that the state of a row at the beginning of a transaction is not tracked here,
/// but rather in the `CommittedState` structure.
///
/// Note that because a transaction may have several operations performed on the same
/// row, it is not the case that a call to insert a row guarantees that the row
/// will be present in `insert_tables`. Rather, a row will be present in `insert_tables`
/// if the cummulative effect of all the calls results in the row being inserted during
/// this transaction. The same holds for delete tables.
///
/// For a concrete example, suppose a row is already present in a table at the start
/// of a transaction. A call to delete that row will enter it into `delete_tables`.
/// A subsequent call to reinsert that row will not put it into `insert_tables`, but
/// instead remove it from `delete_tables`, as the cummulative effect is to do nothing.
///
/// This data structure also tracks modifications beyond inserting and deleting rows.
/// In particular, creating indexes and sequences is tracked by `insert_tables`.
///
/// This means that we have the following invariants, within `TxState` and also
/// the corresponding `CommittedState`:
///   - any row in `insert_tables` must not be in the associated `CommittedState`
///   - any row in `delete_tables` must be in the associated `CommittedState`
///   - any row cannot be in both `insert_tables` and `delete_tables`
