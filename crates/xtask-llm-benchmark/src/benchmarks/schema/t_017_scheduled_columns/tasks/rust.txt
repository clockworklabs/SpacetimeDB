  - Struct: TickTimer
  - Fields:
    - scheduled_id: u64 (primary key, auto-increment)
    - scheduled_at: ScheduleAt
  - Scheduling:
    - reducer: tick
    - column: scheduled_at

REDUCERS
- tick: scheduled reducer that accepts the scheduled row
- init: insert exactly one row into tick_timer that schedules a repeating interval of 50_000 microseconds
