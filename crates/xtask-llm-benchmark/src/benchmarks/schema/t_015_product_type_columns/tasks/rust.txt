    - street: String
    - zip: i32

TABLE
- profiles
  - Struct: Profile
  - Fields:
    - id: i32 (primary key)
    - home: Address
    - work: Address
    - pos: Position

REDUCERS
- seed: insert exactly one row into profiles
  - (id=1, home=Address{street:"1 Main", zip:11111}, work=Address{street:"2 Broad", zip:22222}, pos=Position{x:7, y:9})
