//       Two cases:
//       - The `Token` used to connect is known, but does not match the `Identity` passed
//         to `connect`. This is undoubtedly the client's fault, as each `Token` uniquely
//         identifies a single `Identity`. The server cannot detect it, because we send
//         only the `Token`.
//       - The `Token` used to connect is unknown by the server. Presumably the server
//         detects this and refuses the connection. Find out and document - pgoldman
