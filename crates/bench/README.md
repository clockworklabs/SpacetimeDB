# spacetimedb-bench
Benchmarking suite for SpacetimeDB using [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs). Provides comparisons between the underlying spacetime datastore, spacetime modules, and sqlite.

Timings for spacetime modules should be understood as *latencies to call a spacetime reducer without network delays*. They include serialization and deserialization times for any arguments passed. There are also separate benchmarks that measure these times on their own.

## Benchmark structure

The complete structure (not yet fully implemented) is as follows:

```
# generic benchmarks:

[db]/[disk]/
    empty_transaction/
    insert_1/[schema]/[index_type]/[load]
    insert_bulk/[schema]/[index_type]/[load]/[count]
    insert_large_value/[count]
    iterate/[schema]/[count]/
    filter/[string, u64]/[index?]/[load]/[count]
    find_unique/u32/[load]/
    delete/[index_type]/[load]/[count]

# "load" refers to the number of rows in the table at the start of the benchmark.

# db: [stdb_raw, stdb_module, sqlite]
# disk: [disk, mem]
# schema: [person, location]
# index_type: [unique, non_unique, multi_index]

# "person" is a schema with 2 ints and a string, "location" is a schema with 3 ints.

serialize/
    bsatn/[schema]/[count]
    json/[schema]/[count]
    product_value/[schema]/[count]

deserialize/
    bsatn/[schema]/[count]
    json/[schema]/[count]

stdb_module/
    print_bulk/[count]
    large_arguments/64KiB/
```

Typically you don't want to run all benchmarks at once, there are a lot of them and it will take many minutes.
You can pass regexes to the bench script to select what slice of benchmarks you'd like. For example,

```sh
cargo bench -- 'stdb_raw/.*/insert_bulk'
```
Will run all of the `insert_bulk` benchmarks against the raw spacetime backend.

Similarly, 
```sh
cargo bench -- 'mem/.*/unique'
```
Will run benchmarks involving unique primary keys against all databases, without writing to disc.

## Adding more

There are two ways to write benchmarks:

- Targeted, non-generic benchmarks (`benches/special.rs`)
- Generic over database backends (`benches/generic.rs`)

### Targeted benchmarks
These are regular [Criterion.rs](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) benchmarks. Nothing fancy, do whatever you like with these. Put them in `benches/special.rs`.

### Generic benchmarks
Generic benchmarks live in `benches/generic.rs`. These benchmarks involve two traits:

- [`BenchDatabase`](src/database.rs), which is implemented by different database backends.
- [`BenchTable`](src/schemas.rs), which is implemented by different benchmark tables.

To add a new generic benchmark, you'll need to:
- Add a relevant method to the `BenchDatabase` trait.
- Implement it for each `BenchDatabase` implementation.
    - [`SQLite`](src/sqlite.rs) will require you to write it as a SQL query and submit that to sqlite.
    - [`SpacetimeRaw`](src/spacetime_raw.rs) will require you to execute the query against the Spacetime database backend directly.
    - [`SpacetimeModule`](src/spacetime_module.rs) will require you to add a reducer to the [`benchmarks`](../../modules/benchmarks/src/lib.rs) crate, and then add logic to invoke your reducer with the correct arguments.
- Add a benchmark harness that actually invokes your method in `benches/generic.rs`.


## Install tools

There are also some scripts that rely on external tools to extract data from the benchmarks.

### Critcmp

- [critcmp](https://github.com/BurntSushi/critcmp) can be used to generate tables
    summarizing changes to criterion.rs benchmarks.

```bash
cargo install critcmp
```

The simplest way to use critcmp is to save two baselines with Criterion's benchmark harness and then compare them. For example:
```bash
cargo bench -- --save-baseline before
cargo bench -- --save-baseline change
critcmp before change
```

### OSX Only

- [cargo-instrument](https://github.com/cmyr/cargo-instruments)

```bash
brew install cargo-instruments
```

```bash
# ./instruments.sh TEMPLATE BENCHMARK BENCHMARK_FILTER
./instruments.sh time generic stdb_raw/mem/insert_bulk/location/multi_index/load=0/count=100
```

Where `TEMPLATE` is one from 

```bash
cargo instruments --list-templates
```


### Linux only

- [cargo-flamegraph](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph)

```bash
cargo install flamegraph
```

You can generate flamegraphs using `flamegraph.sh` script:

```bash
# ./flamegraph.sh BENCH_EXECUTABLE FILTER SVG_PATH
./flamegraph.sh generic stdb_raw/mem/insert_bulk/location/multi_index/load=0/count=100 result.svg"
```
