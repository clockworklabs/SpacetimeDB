## Internal documentation

This project contains interfaces and runtime support code for [BSATN serialization](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/bsatn) in C#. It is the companion of the [BSATN.Codegen](../BSATN.Codegen/) project.

See [`../BSATN.Runtime.Tests/`](../BSATN.Runtime.Tests/) for tests.

### User-facing types

This project contains implementations of a number of wide integer types for compatibility with SpacetimeDB. It also has implementations of a number of "special" SpacetimeDB types, including `Identity`, `ConnectionId`, `Timestamp`, `TimeDuration`, and `ScheduleAt`. These live in [`./Builtins.cs`](./Builtins.cs). It also contains the `AlgebraicType` type, which is not really user-facing but is important internally.

There are also two of important interfaces: `IStructuralReadWrite` and  `IReadWrite<T>`. See their documentation in [`./BSATN/Runtime.cs`](./BSATN/Runtime.cs) for more information.

### Internal types

This project contains the base implementation of serializers for various primitive BSATN types. These live in [`./BSATN/Runtime.cs`](./BSATN/Runtime.cs). These serializers are mainly used in code generated by `BSATN.Codegen`.
