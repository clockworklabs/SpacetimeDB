//! `CallbackMap`, a set of callbacks which run asynchronously in response to messages.
//!
//! The SpacetimeDB Rust Client SDK embraces a callback-driven API,
//! where client authors register callbacks to later run in response to some event.
//!
//! Client authors may want to register multiple callbacks on the same event,
//! and then to remove specific callbacks while leaving others,
//! so we define a `CallbackId` type which uniquely identifies a registered callback,
//! and can be used to remove it.
//!
//! Callbacks may access the global `CONNECTION`, individual `TableCache`s,
//! or register or remove other callbacks. This means that the event source,
//! e.g. a `TableCache`, cannot hold its callbacks directly; doing so would require
//! a `Mutex` or `RwLock` and cause deadlocks when the callbacks attempted to re-acquire it.
//! Instead, a `CallbackMap` holds a channel to a background worker,
//! which runs the callbacks without a lock held.
