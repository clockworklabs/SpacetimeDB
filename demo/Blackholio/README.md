# **Blackholio**

**Blackholio** is a small-scoped MMORPG built using Unity and [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com), designed to showcase scalable multiplayer game development. Inspired by [agar.io](https://agar.io), **Blackholio** reimagines the mechanics with a space theme where players become planets, stars, and black holes in a competitive cosmic arena.

### **Game Overview**
- **Gameplay:** Absorb smaller entities, grow, evolve, and dominate the leaderboard as a black hole.
- **Scale:** Supports hundreds of players seamlessly with SpacetimeDB's real-time synchronization.
- **Objective:** Demonstrate SpacetimeDB's features and best practices in a fun, interactive project.

## **Tutorial Overview**

This repository accompanies the **Blackholio Unity Tutorial**, which guides you through building the game from scratch while learning:
- **Unity integration** with SpacetimeDB.
- Client-server setup for multiplayer games.
- SpacetimeDB features, including reducers, tables, and scheduled events.

By following the tutorial, you'll develop:
1. A basic understanding of SpacetimeDB for multiplayer games.
2. A functional game prototype with scalable multiplayer features.

### **Getting Started**
If you want to follow a more structured tutorial where it shows you how to set everything up, start with our [Blackholio Tutorial](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/unity/part-1).

If you just want to checkout the final project and play around a bit, follow these steps:

1. [Install SpacetimeDB CLI](https://spacetimedb.com/install)
2. Start SpacetimeDB in a separate terminal with `spacetime start`.
3. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ClockworkLabs/Blackholio.git
   cd Blackholio
   ```
4. Publish the server logic. You can either publish the csharp server or the rust server.
   ```bash
   cd server-rust/
   # Upload the module to SpacetimeDB
   bash ./publish.sh
   # Update the client bindings in case they are out of date
   bash ./generate.sh
   ```
5. Install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) and Unity version **2021.2** or newer.
6. Open the scene named `Main.unity`
7. Hit play!

You should be prompted for a username and you should be able to move around, eat food and defeat other players!
