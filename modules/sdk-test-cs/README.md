# `sdk-test-cs` *C#* test

See the [sdk-test README](../sdk-test/README.md) for more details.

> **WARNING**: This C# source code is manually derived from `../sdk-test/src/lib.rs` and is supposed to be functionally
> equivalent.
> Do not add new types or functionality here that are not present in the *Rust* version, because they're compared
> against each other.
