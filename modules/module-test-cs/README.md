# `Module` *C#* test

See the [module-test README](../module-test/README.md) for more details.

> **WARNING**: This C# source code is manually derived from `../module-test/src/lib.rs`` and is supposed to be
> functionally equivalent.
> Do not add new types or functionality here that are not present in the *Rust* version, because they're compared
> against each other.
