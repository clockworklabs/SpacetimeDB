# `sdk-test-connect-disconnect-cs` *C#* test

See the [sdk-test-connect-disconnect README](../sdk-test-connect-disconnect/README.md) for more details.

> **WARNING**: This C# source code is manually derived from `../sdk-test-connect-disconnect/src/lib.rs` and is supposed
> to be functionally equivalent.
> Do not add new types or functionality here that is not present in the *Rust* version, because they're compared against
> each other
