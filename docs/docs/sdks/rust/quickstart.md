# Rust Client SDK Quick Start

In this guide we'll show you how to get up and running with a simple SpacetimeDB app with a client written in Rust.

We'll implement a command-line client for the module created in our Rust or C# Module Quickstart guides. Make sure you follow one of these guides before you start on this one.

## Project structure

Enter the directory `quickstart-chat` you created in the [Rust Module Quickstart](/docs/modules/rust/quickstart) or [C# Module Quickstart](/docs/modules/c-sharp/quickstart) guides:

```bash
cd quickstart-chat
```

Within it, create a `client` crate, our client application, which users run locally:

```bash
cargo new client
```

## Depend on `spacetimedb-sdk` and `hex`

`client/Cargo.toml` should be initialized without any dependencies. We'll need two:

- [`spacetimedb-sdk`](https://crates.io/crates/spacetimedb-sdk), which defines client-side interfaces for interacting with a remote SpacetimeDB database.
- [`hex`](https://crates.io/crates/hex), which we'll use to print unnamed users' identities as hexadecimal strings.

Below the `[dependencies]` line in `client/Cargo.toml`, add:

```toml
spacetimedb-sdk = "1.0"
hex = "0.4"
```

Make sure you depend on the same version of `spacetimedb-sdk` as is reported by the SpacetimeDB CLI tool's `spacetime version`!

## Clear `client/src/main.rs`

`client/src/main.rs` should be initialized with a trivial "Hello world" program. Clear it out so we can write our chat client.

In your `quickstart-chat` directory, run:

```bash
rm client/src/main.rs
touch client/src/main.rs
```

## Generate your module types

The `spacetime` CLI's `generate` command will generate client-side interfaces for the tables, reducers and types referenced by tables or reducers defined in your server module.

In your `quickstart-chat` directory, run:

```bash
mkdir -p client/src/module_bindings
spacetime generate --lang rust --out-dir client/src/module_bindings --project-path server
```

Take a look inside `client/src/module_bindings`. The CLI should have generated a few files:

```
module_bindings/
├── identity_connected_reducer.rs
├── identity_disconnected_reducer.rs
├── message_table.rs
├── message_type.rs
├── mod.rs
├── send_message_reducer.rs
├── set_name_reducer.rs
├── user_table.rs
└── user_type.rs
```

To use these, we'll declare the module in our client crate and import its definitions.

To `client/src/main.rs`, add:

```rust
mod module_bindings;
use module_bindings::*;
```

## Add more imports

We'll need additional imports from `spacetimedb_sdk` for interacting with the database, handling credentials, and managing events.

To `client/src/main.rs`, add:

```rust
use spacetimedb_sdk::{credentials, DbContext, Error, Event, Identity, Status, Table, TableWithPrimaryKey};
```

## Define the main function

Our `main` function will do the following:
1. Connect to the database.
2. Register a number of callbacks to run in response to various database events.
3. Subscribe to a set of SQL queries, whose results will be replicated and automatically updated in our client.
4. Spawn a background thread where our connection will process messages and invoke callbacks.
5. Enter a loop to handle user input from the command line.

We'll see the implementation of these functions a bit later, but for now add to `client/src/main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Connect to the database
    let ctx = connect_to_db();

    // Register callbacks to run in response to database events.
    register_callbacks(&ctx);

    // Subscribe to SQL queries in order to construct a local partial replica of the database.
    subscribe_to_tables(&ctx);

    // Spawn a thread, where the connection will process messages and invoke callbacks.
    ctx.run_threaded();

    // Handle CLI input
    user_input_loop(&ctx);
}
```

## Connect to the database

A connection to a SpacetimeDB database is represented by a `DbConnection`. We configure `DbConnection`s using the builder pattern, by calling `DbConnection::builder()`, chaining method calls to set various connection parameters and register callbacks, then we cap it off with a call to `.build()` to begin the connection.

In our case, we'll supply the following options:

1. An `on_connect` callback, to run when the remote database acknowledges and accepts our connection.
2. An `on_connect_error` callback, to run if the remote database is unreachable or it rejects our connection.
3. An `on_disconnect` callback, to run when our connection ends.
4. A `with_token` call, to supply a token to authenticate with.
5. A `with_module_name` call, to specify the name or `Identity` of our database. Make sure to pass the same name here as you supplied to `spacetime publish`.
6. A `with_uri` call, to specify the URI of the SpacetimeDB host where our database is running.

To `client/src/main.rs`, add:

```rust
/// The URI of the SpacetimeDB instance hosting our chat database and module.
const HOST: &str = "http://localhost:3000";

/// The database name we chose when we published our module.
const DB_NAME: &str = "quickstart-chat";

/// Load credentials from a file and connect to the database.
fn connect_to_db() -> DbConnection {
    DbConnection::builder()
        // Register our `on_connect` callback, which will save our auth token.
        .on_connect(on_connected)
        // Register our `on_connect_error` callback, which will print a message, then exit the process.
        .on_connect_error(on_connect_error)
        // Our `on_disconnect` callback, which will print a message, then exit the process.
        .on_disconnect(on_disconnected)
        // If the user has previously connected, we'll have saved a token in the `on_connect` callback.
        // In that case, we'll load it and pass it to `with_token`,
        // so we can re-authenticate as the same `Identity`.
        .with_token(creds_store().load().expect("Error loading credentials"))
        // Set the database name we chose when we called `spacetime publish`.
        .with_module_name(DB_NAME)
        // Set the URI of the SpacetimeDB host that's running our database.
        .with_uri(HOST)
        // Finalize configuration and connect!
        .build()
        .expect("Failed to connect")
}
```

### Save credentials

SpacetimeDB will accept any [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) compliant [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) and use it to compute an `Identity` for the user. More complex applications will generally authenticate their user somehow, generate or retrieve a token, and attach it to their connection via `with_token`. In our case, though, we'll connect anonymously the first time, let SpacetimeDB generate a fresh `Identity` and corresponding JWT for us, and save that token locally to re-use the next time we connect.

The Rust SDK provides a pair of functions in `File`, `save` and `load`, for saving and storing these credentials in a file. By default the `save` and `load` will look for credentials in the `$HOME/.spacetimedb_client_credentials/` directory, which should be unintrusive. If saving our credentials fails, we'll print a message to standard error, but otherwise continue; even though the user won't be able to reconnect with the same identity, they can still chat normally.

To `client/src/main.rs`, add:

```rust
fn creds_store() -> credentials::File {
    credentials::File::new("quickstart-chat")
}

/// Our `on_connect` callback: save our credentials to a file.
fn on_connected(_ctx: &DbConnection, _identity: Identity, token: &str) {
    if let Err(e) = creds_store().save(token) {
        eprintln!("Failed to save credentials: {:?}", e);
    }
}
```

### Handle errors and disconnections

We need to handle connection errors and disconnections by printing appropriate messages and exiting the program. These callbacks take an `ErrorContext`, a `DbConnection` that's been augmented with information about the error that occured.

To `client/src/main.rs`, add:

```rust
/// Our `on_connect_error` callback: print the error, then exit the process.
fn on_connect_error(_ctx: &ErrorContext, err: Error) {
    eprintln!("Connection error: {:?}", err);
    std::process::exit(1);
}

/// Our `on_disconnect` callback: print a note, then exit the process.
fn on_disconnected(_ctx: &ErrorContext, err: Option<Error>) {
    if let Some(err) = err {
        eprintln!("Disconnected: {}", err);
        std::process::exit(1);
    } else {
        println!("Disconnected.");
        std::process::exit(0);
    }
}
```

## Register callbacks

We need to handle several sorts of events:

1. When a new user joins, we'll print a message introducing them.
2. When a user is updated, we'll print their new name, or declare their new online status.
3. When we receive a new message, we'll print it.
4. If the server rejects our attempt to set our name, we'll print an error.
5. If the server rejects a message we send, we'll print an error.

To `client/src/main.rs`, add:

```rust
/// Register all the callbacks our app will use to respond to database events.
fn register_callbacks(ctx: &DbConnection) {
    // When a new user joins, print a notification.
    ctx.db.user().on_insert(on_user_inserted);

    // When a user's status changes, print a notification.
    ctx.db.user().on_update(on_user_updated);

    // When a new message is received, print it.
    ctx.db.message().on_insert(on_message_inserted);

    // When we fail to set our name, print a warning.
    ctx.reducers.on_set_name(on_name_set);

    // When we fail to send a message, print a warning.
    ctx.reducers.on_send_message(on_message_sent);
}
```

### Notify about new users

For each table, we can register on-insert and on-delete callbacks to be run whenever a subscribed row is inserted or deleted. We register these callbacks using the `on_insert` and `on_delete`, which is automatically implemented for each table by `spacetime generate`.

These callbacks can fire in several contexts, of which we care about two:

- After a reducer runs, when the client's cache is updated about changes to subscribed rows.
- After calling `subscribe`, when the client's cache is initialized with all existing matching rows.

This second case means that, even though the module only ever inserts online users, the client's `conn.db.user().on_insert(..)` callbacks may be invoked with users who are offline. We'll only notify about online users.

`on_insert` and `on_delete` callbacks take two arguments: an `&EventContext` and the modified row. Like the `ErrorContext` above, `EventContext` is a `DbConnection` that's been augmented with information about the event that caused the row to be modified. You can determine whether the insert/delete operation was caused by a reducer, a newly-applied subscription, or some other event by pattern-matching on `ctx.event`.

Whenever we want to print a user, if they have set a name, we'll use that. If they haven't set a name, we'll instead print the first 8 bytes of their identity, encoded as hexadecimal. We'll define functions `user_name_or_identity` and `identity_leading_hex` to handle this.

To `client/src/main.rs`, add:

```rust
/// Our `User::on_insert` callback:
/// if the user is online, print a notification.
fn on_user_inserted(_ctx: &EventContext, user: &User) {
    if user.online {
        println!("User {} connected.", user_name_or_identity(user));
    }
}

fn user_name_or_identity(user: &User) -> String {
    user.name
        .clone()
        .unwrap_or_else(|| user.identity.to_hex().to_string())
}
```

### Notify about updated users

Because we declared a `#[primary_key]` column in our `User` table, we can also register on-update callbacks. These run whenever a row is replaced by a row with the same primary key, like our module's `ctx.db.user().identity().update(..)` calls. We register these callbacks using the `on_update` method of the trait `TableWithPrimaryKey`, which is automatically implemented by `spacetime generate` for any table with a `#[primary_key]` column.

`on_update` callbacks take three arguments: the `&EventContext`, the old row, and the new row.

In our module, users can be updated for three reasons:

1. They've set their name using the `set_name` reducer.
2. They're an existing user re-connecting, so their `online` has been set to `true`.
3. They've disconnected, so their `online` has been set to `false`.

We'll print an appropriate message in each of these cases.

To `client/src/main.rs`, add:

```rust
/// Our `User::on_update` callback:
/// print a notification about name and status changes.
fn on_user_updated(_ctx: &EventContext, old: &User, new: &User) {
    if old.name != new.name {
        println!(
            "User {} renamed to {}.",
            user_name_or_identity(old),
            user_name_or_identity(new)
        );
    }
    if old.online && !new.online {
        println!("User {} disconnected.", user_name_or_identity(new));
    }
    if !old.online && new.online {
        println!("User {} connected.", user_name_or_identity(new));
    }
}
```

### Print messages

When we receive a new message, we'll print it to standard output, along with the name of the user who sent it. Keep in mind that we only want to do this for new messages, i.e. those inserted by a `send_message` reducer invocation. We have to handle the backlog we receive when our subscription is initialized separately, to ensure they're printed in the correct order. To that effect, our `on_message_inserted` callback will check if the ctx.event type is an `Event::Reducer`, and only print in that case.

To find the `User` based on the message's `sender` identity, we'll use `ctx.db.user().identity().find(..)`, which behaves like the same function on the server.

We'll print the user's name or identity in the same way as we did when notifying about `User` table events, but here we have to handle the case where we don't find a matching `User` row. This can happen when the module owner sends a message using the CLI's `spacetime call`. In this case, we'll print `unknown`.

Notice that our `print_message` function takes an `&impl RemoteDbContext` as an argument. This is a trait, defined in our `module_bindings` by `spacetime generate`, which is implemented by `DbConnection`, `EventContext`, `ErrorContext` and a few other similar types. (`RemoteDbContext` is actually a shorthand for `DbContext`, which applies to connections to *any* module, with its associated types locked to module-specific ones.) Later on, we're going to call `print_message` with a `ReducerEventContext`, so we need to be more generic than just accepting `EventContext`.

To `client/src/main.rs`, add:

```rust
/// Our `Message::on_insert` callback: print new messages.
fn on_message_inserted(ctx: &EventContext, message: &Message) {
    if let Event::Reducer(_) = ctx.event {
        print_message(ctx, message)
    }
}

fn print_message(ctx: &impl RemoteDbContext, message: &Message) {
    let sender = ctx
        .db()
        .user()
        .identity()
        .find(&message.sender.clone())
        .map(|u| user_name_or_identity(&u))
        .unwrap_or_else(|| "unknown".to_string());
    println!("{}: {}", sender, message.text);
}
```

### Handle reducer failures

We can also register callbacks to run each time a reducer is invoked. We register these callbacks using the `on_reducer` method of the `Reducer` trait, which is automatically implemented for each reducer by `spacetime generate`.

Each reducer callback first takes a `&ReducerEventContext` which contains metadata about the reducer call, including the identity of the caller and whether or not the reducer call suceeded.

These callbacks will be invoked in one of two cases:

1. If the reducer was successful and altered any of our subscribed rows.
2. If we requested an invocation which failed.

Note that a status of `Failed` or `OutOfEnergy` implies that the caller identity is our own identity.

We already handle successful `set_name` invocations using our `ctx.db.user().on_update(..)` callback, but if the module rejects a user's chosen name, we'd like that user's client to let them know. We define a function `on_set_name` as a `conn.reducers.on_set_name(..)` callback which checks if the reducer failed, and if it did, prints a message including the rejected name and the error.


To `client/src/main.rs`, add:

```rust
/// Our `on_set_name` callback: print a warning if the reducer failed.
fn on_name_set(ctx: &ReducerEventContext, name: &String) {
    if let Status::Failed(err) = &ctx.event.status {
        eprintln!("Failed to change name to {:?}: {}", name, err);
    }
}

/// Our `on_send_message` callback: print a warning if the reducer failed.
fn on_message_sent(ctx: &ReducerEventContext, text: &String) {
    if let Status::Failed(err) = &ctx.event.status {
        eprintln!("Failed to send message {:?}: {}", text, err);
    }
}
```

## Subscribe to queries

SpacetimeDB is set up so that each client subscribes via SQL queries to some subset of the database, and is notified about changes only to that subset. For complex apps with large databases, judicious subscriptions can save each client significant network bandwidth, memory and computation. For example, in [BitCraft](https://bitcraftonline.com), each player's client subscribes only to the entities in the "chunk" of the world where that player currently resides, rather than the entire game world. Our app is much simpler than BitCraft, so we'll just subscribe to the whole database.

When we specify our subscriptions, we can supply an `on_applied` callback. This will run when the subscription is applied and the matching rows become available in our client cache. We'll use this opportunity to print the message backlog in proper order.

We'll also provide an `on_error` callback. This will run if the subscription fails, usually due to an invalid or malformed SQL queries. We can't handle this case, so we'll just print out the error and exit the process.

To `client/src/main.rs`, add:

```rust
/// Register subscriptions for all rows of both tables.
fn subscribe_to_tables(ctx: &DbConnection) {
    ctx.subscription_builder()
        .on_applied(on_sub_applied)
        .on_error(on_sub_error)
        .subscribe(["SELECT * FROM user", "SELECT * FROM message"]);
}
```

### Print past messages in order

Messages we receive live will come in order, but when we connect, we'll receive all the past messages at once. We can't just print these in the order we receive them; the logs would be all shuffled around, and would make no sense. Instead, when we receive the log of past messages, we'll sort them by their sent timestamps and print them in order.

We'll handle this in our function `print_messages_in_order`, which we registered as an `on_applied` callback. `print_messages_in_order` iterates over all the `Message`s we've received, sorts them, and then prints them. `ctx.db.message().iter()` is defined on the trait `Table`, and returns an iterator over all the messages in the client cache. Rust iterators can't be sorted in-place, so we'll collect it to a `Vec`, then use the `sort_by_key` method to sort by timestamp.

To `client/src/main.rs`, add:

```rust
/// Our `on_subscription_applied` callback:
/// sort all past messages and print them in timestamp order.
fn on_sub_applied(ctx: &SubscriptionEventContext) {
    let mut messages = ctx.db.message().iter().collect::<Vec<_>>();
    messages.sort_by_key(|m| m.sent);
    for message in messages {
        print_message(ctx, &message);
    }
    println!("Fully connected and all subscriptions applied.");
    println!("Use /name to set your name, or type a message!");
}
```

### Notify about failed subscriptions

It's possible for SpacetimeDB to reject subscriptions. This happens most often because of a typo in the SQL queries, but can be due to use of SQL features that SpacetimeDB doesn't support. See [SQL Support: Subscriptions](/docs/sql#subscriptions) for more information about what subscription queries SpacetimeDB supports.

In our case, we're pretty confident that our queries are valid, but if SpacetimeDB rejects them, we want to know about it. Our callback will print the error, then exit the process.

```rust
/// Or `on_error` callback:
/// print the error, then exit the process.
fn on_sub_error(_ctx: &ErrorContext, err: Error) {
    eprintln!("Subscription failed: {}", err);
    std::process::exit(1);
}
```

## Handle user input

Our app should allow the user to interact by typing lines into their terminal. If the line starts with `/name `, we'll change the user's name. Any other line will send a message.

For each reducer defined by our module, `ctx.reducers` has a method to request an invocation. In our case, we pass `set_name` and `send_message` a `String`, which gets sent to the server to execute the corresponding reducer.

To `client/src/main.rs`, add:

```rust
/// Read each line of standard input, and either set our name or send a message as appropriate.
fn user_input_loop(ctx: &DbConnection) {
    for line in std::io::stdin().lines() {
        let Ok(line) = line else {
            panic!("Failed to read from stdin.");
        };
        if let Some(name) = line.strip_prefix("/name ") {
            ctx.reducers.set_name(name.to_string()).unwrap();
        } else {
            ctx.reducers.send_message(line).unwrap();
        }
    }
}
```

## Run it

After setting everything up, change your directory to the client app, then compile and run it. From the `quickstart-chat` directory, run:

```bash
cd client
cargo run
```

You should see something like:

```
User d9e25c51996dea2f connected.
```

Now try sending a message by typing `Hello, world!` and pressing enter. You should see:

```
d9e25c51996dea2f: Hello, world!
```

Next, set your name by typing `/name <my-name>`, replacing `<my-name>` with your desired username. You should see:

```
User d9e25c51996dea2f renamed to <my-name>.
```

Then, send another message:

```
<my-name>: Hello after naming myself.
```

Now, close the app by hitting `Ctrl+C`, and start it again with `cargo run`. You'll see yourself connecting, and your past messages will load in order:

```
User <my-name> connected.
<my-name>: Hello, world!
<my-name>: Hello after naming myself.
```

## What's next?

You can find the full code for this client [in the Rust client SDK's examples](https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB/tree/master/crates/sdk/examples/quickstart-chat).

Check out the [Rust client SDK Reference](/docs/sdks/rust) for a more comprehensive view of the SpacetimeDB Rust client SDK.

Our basic terminal interface has some limitations. Incoming messages can appear while the user is typing, which is less than ideal. Additionally, the user's input gets mixed with the program's output, making messages the user sends appear twice. You might want to try improving the interface by using [Rustyline](https://crates.io/crates/rustyline), [Cursive](https://crates.io/crates/cursive), or even creating a full-fledged GUI.

Once your chat server runs for a while, you might want to limit the messages your client loads by refining your `Message` subscription query, only subscribing to messages sent within the last half-hour.

You could also add features like:

- Styling messages by interpreting HTML tags and printing appropriate [ANSI escapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).
- Adding a `moderator` flag to the `User` table, allowing moderators to manage users (e.g., time-out, ban).
- Adding rooms or channels that users can join or leave.
- Supporting direct messages or displaying user statuses next to their usernames.
