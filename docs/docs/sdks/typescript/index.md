## Project setup

First, create a new client project, and add the following to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    //You can use any target higher than this one
    //https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#target
    "target": "es2015"
  }
}
```

Then add the SpacetimeDB SDK to your dependencies:

```bash
cd client
npm install @clockworklabs/spacetimedb-sdk
```

You should have this folder layout starting from the root of your project:

```bash
quickstart-chat
├── client
│   ├── node_modules
│   ├── public
│   └── src
└── server
    └── src
```

### Tip for utilities/scripts

If want to create a quick script to test your module bindings from the command line, you can use https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx to execute TypeScript files.

Then you create a `script.ts` file and add the imports, code and execute with:

```bash
npx tsx src/script.ts
```

## Generate module bindings

Each SpacetimeDB client depends on some bindings specific to your module. Create a `module_bindings` directory in your project's `src` directory and generate the Typescript interface files using the Spacetime CLI. From your project directory, run:

```bash
mkdir -p client/src/module_bindings
spacetime generate --lang typescript \
    --out-dir client/src/module_bindings \
    --project-path PATH-TO-MODULE-DIRECTORY
```

Import the `module_bindings` in your client's _main_ file:

```typescript
import * as moduleBindings from './module_bindings/index';
```

You may also need to import some definitions from the SDK library:

```typescript
import {
  Identity, ConnectionId, Event, ReducerEvent
} from '@clockworklabs/spacetimedb-sdk';
```

## Type `DbConnection`

```typescript
DbConnection
```

A connection to a remote database is represented by the `DbConnection` type. This type is generated per-module, and contains information about the types, tables and reducers defined by your module.

| Name                                                      | Description                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Connect to a database](#connect-to-a-database)               | Construct a `DbConnection`.                                                                      |
| [Access tables and reducers](#access-tables-and-reducers) | Access subscribed rows in the client cache, request reducer invocations, and register callbacks. |


### Connect to a database

```typescript
class DbConnection {
  public static builder(): DbConnectionBuilder
}
```

Construct a `DbConnection` by calling `DbConnection.builder()` and chaining configuration methods, then calling `.build()`. You must at least specify `withUri`, to supply the URI of the SpacetimeDB to which you published your module, and `withModuleName`, to supply the human-readable SpacetimeDB domain name or the raw `Identity` which identifies the database.

| Name                                                  | Description                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`withUri` method](#method-withuri)                   | Set the URI of the SpacetimeDB instance which hosts the remote database.             |
| [`withModuleName` method](#method-withmodulename)     | Set the name or `Identity` of the remote database.                                   |
| [`onConnect` callback](#callback-onconnect)           | Register a callback to run when the connection is successfully established.          |
| [`onConnectError` callback](#callback-onconnecterror) | Register a callback to run if the connection is rejected or the host is unreachable. |
| [`onDisconnect` callback](#callback-ondisconnect)     | Register a callback to run when the connection ends.                                 |
| [`withToken` method](#method-withtoken)               | Supply a token to authenticate with the remote database.                             |
| [`build` method](#method-build)                       | Finalize configuration and connect.                                                  |

#### Method `withUri`

```typescript
class DbConnectionBuilder {
  public withUri(uri: string): DbConnectionBuilder
}
```

Configure the URI of the SpacetimeDB instance or cluster which hosts the remote database.

#### Method `withModuleName`

```typescript
class DbConnectionBuilder {
  public withModuleName(name_or_identity: string): DbConnectionBuilder
}

```

Configure the SpacetimeDB domain name or hex string encoded `Identity` of the remote database which identifies it within the SpacetimeDB instance or cluster.

#### Callback `onConnect`

```typescript
class DbConnectionBuilder {
  public onConnect(
    callback: (ctx: DbConnection, identity: Identity, token: string) => void
  ): DbConnectionBuilder
}
```

Chain a call to `.onConnect(callback)` to your builder to register a callback to run when your new `DbConnection` successfully initiates its connection to the remote database. The callback accepts three arguments: a reference to the `DbConnection`, the `Identity` by which SpacetimeDB identifies this connection, and a private access token which can be saved and later passed to [`withToken`](#method-withtoken) to authenticate the same user in future connections.

#### Callback `onConnectError`

```typescript
class DbConnectionBuilder {
  public onConnectError(
    callback: (ctx: ErrorContext, error: Error) => void
  ): DbConnectionBuilder
}
```

Chain a call to `.onConnectError(callback)` to your builder to register a callback to run when your connection fails.

#### Callback `onDisconnect`

```typescript
class DbConnectionBuilder {
  public onDisconnect(
    callback: (ctx: ErrorContext, error: Error | null) => void
  ): DbConnectionBuilder
}
```

Chain a call to `.onDisconnect(callback)` to your builder to register a callback to run when your `DbConnection` disconnects from the remote database, either as a result of a call to [`disconnect`](#method-disconnect) or due to an error.

#### Method `withToken`

```typescript
class DbConnectionBuilder {
  public withToken(token?: string): DbConnectionBuilder
}
```

Chain a call to `.withToken(token)` to your builder to provide an OpenID Connect compliant JSON Web Token to authenticate with, or to explicitly select an anonymous connection. If this method is not called or `null` is passed, SpacetimeDB will generate a new `Identity` and sign a new private access token for the connection.


#### Method `build`

```typescript
class DbConnectionBuilder {
  public build(): DbConnection
}
```

After configuring the connection and registering callbacks, attempt to open the connection.

### Access tables and reducers

#### Field `db`

```typescript
class DbConnection {
  public db: RemoteTables
}
```

The `db` field of the `DbConnection` provides access to the subscribed view of the remote database's tables. See [Access the client cache](#access-the-client-cache).

#### Field `reducers`

```typescript
class DbConnection {
  public reducers: RemoteReducers
}
```

The `reducers` field of the `DbConnection` provides access to reducers exposed by the remote module. See [Observe and invoke reducers](#observe-and-invoke-reducers).

## Interface `DbContext`

```typescript
interface DbContext<
    DbView,
    Reducers,
>
```

[`DbConnection`](#type-dbconnection), [`EventContext`](#type-eventcontext), [`ReducerEventContext`](#type-reducereventcontext), [`SubscriptionEventContext`](#type-subscriptioneventcontext) and [`ErrorContext`](#type-errorcontext) all implement `DbContext`. `DbContext` has fields and methods for inspecting and configuring your connection to the remote database.

The `DbContext` interface is implemented by connections and contexts to *every* module. This means that its [`DbView`](#field-db) and [`Reducers`](#field-reducers) are generic types.

| Name                                                  | Description                                                              |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`db` field](#field-db)                               | Access subscribed rows of tables and register row callbacks.             |
| [`reducers` field](#field-reducers)                   | Request reducer invocations and register reducer callbacks.              |
| [`disconnect` method](#method-disconnect)             | End the connection.                                                      |
| [Subscribe to queries](#subscribe-to-queries)         | Register SQL queries to receive updates about matching rows.             |
| [Read connection metadata](#read-connection-metadata) | Access the connection's `Identity` and `ConnectionId`                    |

#### Field `db`

```typescript
interface DbContext {
  db: DbView
}
```

The `db` field of a `DbContext` provides access to the subscribed view of the remote database's tables. See [Access the client cache](#access-the-client-cache).

#### Field `reducers`

```typescript
interface DbContext {
  reducers: Reducers
}
```

The `reducers` field of a `DbContext` provides access to reducers exposed by the remote module. See [Observe and invoke reducers](#observe-and-invoke-reducers).

### Method `disconnect`

```typescript
interface DbContext {
  disconnect(): void
}
```

Gracefully close the `DbConnection`. Throws an error if the connection is already disconnected.

### Subscribe to queries

| Name                                                    | Description                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`SubscriptionBuilder` type](#type-subscriptionbuilder) | Builder-pattern constructor to register subscribed queries. |
| [`SubscriptionHandle` type](#type-subscriptionhandle)   | Manage an active subscripion.                               |

#### Type `SubscriptionBuilder`

```typescript
SubscriptionBuilder
```

| Name                                                                           | Description                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`ctx.subscriptionBuilder()` constructor](#constructor-ctxsubscriptionbuilder) | Begin configuring a new subscription.                           |
| [`onApplied` callback](#callback-onapplied)                                    | Register a callback to run when matching rows become available. |
| [`onError` callback](#callback-onerror)                                        | Register a callback to run if the subscription fails.           |
| [`subscribe` method](#method-subscribe)                                        | Finish configuration and subscribe to one or more SQL queries.  |
| [`subscribeToAllTables` method](#method-subscribetoalltables)                  | Convenience method to subscribe to the entire database.         |

##### Constructor `ctx.subscriptionBuilder()`

```typescript
interface DbContext {
  subscriptionBuilder(): SubscriptionBuilder
}
```

Subscribe to queries by calling `ctx.subscription_builder()` and chaining configuration methods, then calling `.subscribe(queries)`.

##### Callback `onApplied`

```typescript
class SubscriptionBuilder {
  public onApplied(
    callback: (ctx: SubscriptionEventContext) => void
  ): SubscriptionBuilder
}
```

Register a callback to run when the subscription is applied and the matching rows are inserted into the client cache.

##### Callback `onError`

```typescript
class SubscriptionBuilder {
  public onError(
    callback: (ctx: ErrorContext, error: Error) => void
  ): SubscriptionBuilder
}
```

Register a callback to run if the subscription is rejected or unexpectedly terminated by the server. This is most frequently caused by passing an invalid query to [`subscribe`](#method-subscribe).


##### Method `subscribe`

```typescript
class SubscriptionBuilder {
  subscribe(queries: string | string[]): SubscriptionHandle
}
```

Subscribe to a set of queries.

See [the SpacetimeDB SQL Reference](/docs/sql#subscriptions) for information on the queries SpacetimeDB supports as subscriptions.

##### Method `subscribeToAllTables`

```typescript
class SubscriptionBuilder {
  subscribeToAllTables(): void
}
```

Subscribe to all rows from all public tables. This method is provided as a convenience for simple clients. The subscription initiated by `subscribeToAllTables` cannot be canceled after it is initiated. You should [`subscribe` to specific queries](#method-subscribe) if you need fine-grained control over the lifecycle of your subscriptions.

#### Type `SubscriptionHandle`

```typescript
SubscriptionHandle
```

A `SubscriptionHandle` represents a subscribed query or a group of subscribed queries.

The `SubscriptionHandle` does not contain or provide access to the subscribed rows. Subscribed rows of all subscriptions by a connection are contained within that connection's [`ctx.db`](#field-db). See [Access the client cache](#access-the-client-cache).

| Name                                                | Description                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`isEnded` method](#method-isended)                 | Determine whether the subscription has ended.                                                                    |
| [`isActive` method](#method-isactive)               | Determine whether the subscription is active and its matching rows are present in the client cache.              |
| [`unsubscribe` method](#method-unsubscribe)         | Discard a subscription.                                                                                          |
| [`unsubscribeThen` method](#method-unsubscribethen) | Discard a subscription, and register a callback to run when its matching rows are removed from the client cache. |

##### Method `isEnded`

```typescript
class SubscriptionHandle {
  public isEnded(): bool
}
```

Returns true if this subscription has been terminated due to an unsubscribe call or an error.

##### Method `isActive`

```typescript
class SubscriptionHandle {
  public isActive(): bool
}
```

Returns true if this subscription has been applied and has not yet been unsubscribed.

##### Method `unsubscribe`

```typescript
class SubscriptionHandle {
  public unsubscribe(): void
}
```

Terminate this subscription, causing matching rows to be removed from the client cache. Any rows removed from the client cache this way will have [`onDelete` callbacks](#callback-ondelete) run for them.

Unsubscribing is an asynchronous operation. Matching rows are not removed from the client cache immediately. Use [`unsubscribeThen`](#method-unsubscribethen) to run a callback once the unsubscribe operation is completed.

Throws an error if the subscription has already ended, either due to a previous call to `unsubscribe` or [`unsubscribeThen`](#method-unsubscribethen), or due to an error.

##### Method `unsubscribeThen`

```typescript
class SubscriptionHandle {
  public unsubscribeThen(
    on_end: (ctx: SubscriptionEventContext) => void
  ): void
}
```

Terminate this subscription, and run the `onEnd` callback when the subscription is ended and its matching rows are removed from the client cache. Any rows removed from the client cache this way will have [`onDelete` callbacks](#callback-ondelete) run for them.

Returns an error if the subscription has already ended, either due to a previous call to [`unsubscribe`](#method-unsubscribe) or `unsubscribeThen`, or due to an error.

### Read connection metadata

#### Field `isActive`

```typescript
interface DbContext {
  isActive: bool
}
```

`true` if the connection has not yet disconnected. Note that a connection `isActive` when it is constructed, before its [`onConnect` callback](#callback-onconnect) is invoked.

## Type `EventContext`

```typescript
EventContext
```

An `EventContext` is a [`DbContext`](#interface-dbcontext) augmented with a field [`event: Event`](#type-event). `EventContext`s are passed as the first argument to row callbacks [`onInsert`](#callback-oninsert), [`onDelete`](#callback-ondelete) and [`onUpdate`](#callback-onupdate).

| Name                                | Description                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`event` field](#field-event)       | Enum describing the cause of the current row callback.        |
| [`db` field](#field-db)             | Provides access to the client cache.                          |
| [`reducers` field](#field-reducers) | Allows requesting reducers run on the remote database.        |
| [`Event` type](#type-event)         | Possible events which can cause a row callback to be invoked. |

### Field `event`

```typescript
class EventContext {
  public event: Event<Reducer>
}
/* other fields */

```

The [`Event`](#type-event) contained in the `EventContext` describes what happened to cause the current row callback to be invoked.

### Field `db`

```typescript
class EventContext {
  public db: RemoteTables
}
```

The `db` field of the context provides access to the subscribed view of the remote database's tables. See [Access the client cache](#access-the-client-cache).

### Field `reducers`

```typescript
class EventContext {
  public reducers: RemoteReducers
}
```

The `reducers` field of the context provides access to reducers exposed by the remote module. See [Observe and invoke reducers](#observe-and-invoke-reducers).

### Type `Event`

```rust
type Event<Reducer> =
  | { tag: 'Reducer'; value: ReducerEvent<Reducer> }
  | { tag: 'SubscribeApplied' }
  | { tag: 'UnsubscribeApplied' }
  | { tag: 'Error'; value: Error }
  | { tag: 'UnknownTransaction' };
```

| [`UnknownTransaction` variant](#variant-unknowntransaction) | A transaction ran in the remote database, but was not attributed to a known reducer.                                                    |
| [`ReducerEvent` type](#type-reducerevent)                   | Metadata about a reducer run. Contained in [`Event::Reducer`](#variant-reducer) and [`ReducerEventContext`](#type-reducereventcontext). |
| [`UpdateStatus` type](#type-updatestatus)                   | Completion status of a reducer run.                                                                                                     |
| [`Reducer` type](#type-reducer)                             | Module-specific generated enum with a variant for each reducer defined by the module.                                                   |

#### Variant `Reducer`

```typescript
{ tag: 'Reducer'; value: ReducerEvent<Reducer> }
```

Event when we are notified that a reducer ran in the remote database. The [`ReducerEvent`](#type-reducerevent) contains metadata about the reducer run, including its arguments and termination status(#type-updatestatus).

This event is passed to row callbacks resulting from modifications by the reducer.

#### Variant `SubscribeApplied`

```typescript
{ tag: 'SubscribeApplied' }
```

Event when our subscription is applied and its rows are inserted into the client cache.

This event is passed to [row `onInsert` callbacks](#callback-oninsert) resulting from the new subscription.

#### Variant `UnsubscribeApplied`

```typescript
{ tag: 'UnsubscribeApplied' }
```

Event when our subscription is removed after a call to [`SubscriptionHandle.unsubscribe`](#method-unsubscribe) or [`SubscriptionHandle.unsubscribeThen`](#method-unsubscribethen) and its matching rows are deleted from the client cache.

This event is passed to [row `onDelete` callbacks](#callback-ondelete) resulting from the subscription ending.

#### Variant `Error`

```typescript
{ tag: 'Error'; value: Error }

```

Event when a subscription ends unexpectedly due to an error.

This event is passed to [row `onDelete` callbacks](#callback-ondelete) resulting from the subscription ending.

#### Variant `UnknownTransaction`

```typescript
{ tag: 'UnknownTransaction' }
```

Event when we are notified of a transaction in the remote database which we cannot associate with a known reducer. This may be an ad-hoc SQL query or a reducer for which we do not have bindings.

This event is passed to [row callbacks](#callback-oninsert) resulting from modifications by the transaction.

### Type `ReducerEvent`

A `ReducerEvent` contains metadata about a reducer run.

```typescript
type ReducerEvent<Reducer> = {
  /**
   * The time when the reducer started running.
   */
  timestamp: Timestamp;

  /**
   * Whether the reducer committed, was aborted due to insufficient energy, or failed with an error message.
   */
  status: UpdateStatus;

  /**
   * The identity of the caller.
   * TODO: Revise these to reflect the forthcoming Identity proposal.
   */
  callerIdentity: Identity;

  /**
   * The connection ID of the caller.
   *
   * May be `null`, e.g. for scheduled reducers.
   */
  callerConnectionId?: ConnectionId;

  /**
   * The amount of energy consumed by the reducer run, in eV.
   * (Not literal eV, but our SpacetimeDB energy unit eV.)
   * May be present or undefined at the implementor's discretion;
   * future work may determine an interface for module developers
   * to request this value be published or hidden.
   */
  energyConsumed?: bigint;

  /**
   * The `Reducer` enum defined by the `moduleBindings`, which encodes which reducer ran and its arguments.
   */
  reducer: Reducer;
};
```

### Type `UpdateStatus`

```typescript
type UpdateStatus =
  | { tag: 'Committed'; value: __DatabaseUpdate }
  | { tag: 'Failed'; value: string }
  | { tag: 'OutOfEnergy' };
```

| Name                                          | Description                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| [`Committed` variant](#variant-committed)     | The reducer ran successfully.                       |
| [`Failed` variant](#variant-failed)           | The reducer errored.                                |
| [`OutOfEnergy` variant](#variant-outofenergy) | The reducer was aborted due to insufficient energy. |

#### Variant `Committed`

```typescript
{ tag: 'Committed' }
```

The reducer returned successfully and its changes were committed into the database state. An [`Event` with `tag: 'Reducer'`](#variant-reducer) passed to a row callback must have this status in its [`ReducerEvent`](#type-reducerevent).

#### Variant `Failed`

```typescript
{ tag: 'Failed'; value: string }
```

The reducer returned an error, panicked, or threw an exception. The `value` is the stringified error message. Formatting of the error message is unstable and subject to change, so clients should use it only as a human-readable diagnostic, and in particular should not attempt to parse the message.

#### Variant `OutOfEnergy`

```typescript
{ tag: 'OutOfEnergy' }
```

The reducer was aborted due to insufficient energy balance of the module owner.

### Type `Reducer`

```rust
type Reducer =
  | { name: 'ReducerA'; args: ReducerA }
  | { name: 'ReducerB'; args: ReducerB }
```

The module bindings contains a type `Reducer` with a variant for each reducer defined by the module. Each variant has a field `args` containing the arguments to the reducer.

## Type `ReducerEventContext`

A `ReducerEventContext` is a [`DbContext`](#interface-dbcontext) augmented with a field [`event: ReducerEvent`](#type-reducerevent). `ReducerEventContext`s are passed as the first argument to [reducer callbacks](#observe-and-invoke-reducers).

| Name                                | Description                                                       |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`event` field](#field-event)       | [`ReducerEvent`](#type-reducerevent) containing reducer metadata. |
| [`db` field](#field-db)             | Provides access to the client cache.                              |

## Type `SubscriptionEventContext`

A `SubscriptionEventContext` is a [`DbContext`](#interface-dbcontext). Unlike the other context types, `SubscriptionEventContext` doesn't have an `event` field. `SubscriptionEventContext`s are passed to subscription [`onApplied`](#callback-onapplied) and [`unsubscribeThen`](#method-unsubscribethen) callbacks.

| Name                                | Description                                                |

}
```

The `reducers` field of the context provides access to reducers exposed by the remote module. See [Observe and invoke reducers](#observe-and-invoke-reducers).

## Access the client cache

All [`DbContext`](#interface-dbcontext) implementors, including [`DbConnection`](#type-dbconnection) and [`EventContext`](#type-eventcontext), have fields `.db`, which in turn has methods for accessing tables in the client cache.

Each table defined by a module has an accessor method, whose name is the table name converted to `camelCase`, on this `.db` field. The table accessor methods return table handles. Table handles have methods for [accessing rows](#accessing-rows) and [registering `onInsert`](#callback-oninsert) and [`onDelete` callbacks](#callback-ondelete). Handles for tables which have a declared primary key field also expose [`onUpdate` callbacks](#callback-onupdate). Table handles also offer the ability to find subscribed rows by unique index.

| Name                                                   | Description                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Accessing rows](#accessing-rows)                      | Iterate over or count subscribed rows.                                          |
| [`onInsert` callback](#callback-oninsert)              | Register a function to run when a row is added to the client cache.             |
| [`onDelete` callback](#callback-ondelete)              | Register a function to run when a row is removed from the client cache.         |
| [`onUpdate` callback](#callback-onupdate)              | Register a function to run when a subscribed row is replaced with a new version. |
| [Unique index access](#unique-constraint-index-access) | Seek a subscribed row by the value in its unique or primary key column.         |
| [BTree index access](#btree-index-access)              | Not supported.                                                                  |

### Accessing rows

#### Method `count`

```typescript
class TableHandle {
  public count(): number
}
```

Returns the number of rows of this table resident in the client cache, i.e. the total number which match any subscribed query.

#### Method `iter`

```typescript
class TableHandle {
  public iter(): Iterable<Row>
}
```

An iterator over all the subscribed rows in the client cache, i.e. those which match any subscribed query.

The `Row` type will be an autogenerated type which matches the row type defined by the module.

### Callback `onInsert`

```typescript
class TableHandle {
  public onInsert(
    callback: (ctx: EventContext, row: Row) => void
  ): void;

  public removeOnInsert(
    callback: (ctx: EventContext, row: Row) => void
  ): void;
}
```

The `onInsert` callback runs whenever a new row is inserted into the client cache, either when applying a subscription or being notified of a transaction. The passed [`EventContext`](#type-eventcontext) contains an [`Event`](#type-event) which can identify the change which caused the insertion, and also allows the callback to interact with the connection, inspect the client cache and invoke reducers.

The `Row` type will be an autogenerated type which matches the row type defined by the module.

`removeOnInsert` may be used to un-register a previously-registered `onInsert` callback.

### Callback `onDelete`

```typescript
class TableHandle {
  public onDelete(
    callback: (ctx: EventContext, row: Row) => void
  ): void;

  public removeOnDelete(
    callback: (ctx: EventContext, row: Row) => void
  ): void;
}
```

The `onDelete` callback runs whenever a previously-resident row is deleted from the client cache.

The `Row` type will be an autogenerated type which matches the row type defined by the module.

`removeOnDelete` may be used to un-register a previously-registered `onDelete` callback.

### Callback `onUpdate`

```typescript
class TableHandle {
  public onUpdate(
    callback: (ctx: EventContext, old: Row, new: Row) => void
  ): void;

  public removeOnUpdate(
    callback: (ctx: EventContext, old: Row, new: Row) => void
  ): void;
}
```

The `onUpdate` callback runs whenever an already-resident row in the client cache is updated, i.e. replaced with a new row that has the same primary key.

Only tables with a declared primary key expose `onUpdate` callbacks. Handles for tables without a declared primary key will not have `onUpdate` or `removeOnUpdate` methods.

The `Row` type will be an autogenerated type which matches the row type defined by the module.

`removeOnUpdate` may be used to un-register a previously-registered `onUpdate` callback.

### Unique constraint index access

For each unique constraint on a table, its table handle has a field whose name is the unique column name. This field is a unique index handle. The unique index handle has a method `.find(desiredValue: Col) -> Row | undefined`, where `Col` is the type of the column, and `Row` the type of rows. If a row with `desiredValue` in the unique column is resident in the client cache, `.find` returns it.

### BTree index access

The SpacetimeDB TypeScript client SDK does not support non-unique BTree indexes.

## Observe and invoke reducers

All [`DbContext`](#interface-dbcontext) implementors, including [`DbConnection`](#type-dbconnection) and [`EventContext`](#type-eventcontext), have fields `.reducers`, which in turn has methods for invoking reducers defined by the module and registering callbacks on it.

Each reducer defined by the module has three methods on the `.reducers`:

- An invoke method, whose name is the reducer's name converted to camel case, like `setName`. This requests that the module run the reducer.
- A callback registation method, whose name is prefixed with `on`, like `onSetName`. This registers a callback to run whenever we are notified that the reducer ran, including successfully committed runs and runs we requested which failed. This method returns a callback id, which can be passed to the callback remove method.
- A callback remove method, whose name is prefixed with `removeOn`, like `removeOnSetName`. This cancels a callback previously registered via the callback registration method.

## Identify a client

### Type `Identity`

```rust
Identity
```

A unique public identifier for a client connected to a database.

### Type `ConnectionId`

```rust
ConnectionId
```

An opaque identifier for a client connection to a database, intended to differentiate between connections from the same [`Identity`](#type-identity).
