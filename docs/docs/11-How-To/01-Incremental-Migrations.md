# Incremental Migrations

SpacetimeDB does not provide built-in support for general schema-modifying migrations. It does, however, allow adding new tables, and changing reducers' definitions in arbitrary ways. It's possible to run general migrations using an external tool, but this is tedious, necessitates downtime, and imposes the requirement that you update all your clients at the same time as publishing your new module version.

Our friends at [Lightfox Games](https://www.lightfoxgames.com/) taught us a pattern they call "incremental migrations," which mitigates all these problems, and works perfectly with SpacetimeDB's capabilities. The short version is that, instead of altering an existing table, you add a new table with the desired new schema. Whenever your module wants to access a row from that table, it first checks the new table. If the row is present in the new table, then you've already migrated, so do whatever you want to do. If the new table doesn't have the row, instead look it up in the old table, compute and insert a row for the new table, and use that. (If the row isn't present in either the old or new table, it's just not present.) If possible, you should also update the row in the old table to match any mutations that happen in the new table, so that outdated clients can still function.

This has several advantages:
- SpacetimeDB's module hotswapping makes this a zero-downtime update. Write your new module, `spacetime publish` it, and watch the new table populate as it's used.
- It amortizes the cost of transforming rows or computing new columns across many transactions. Rows will only be added to the new table when they're needed.
- In many cases, old clients from before the update can coexist with new clients that use the new table. You can publish the updated module without disconnecting your clients, roll out the client update through normal channels, and allow your users to update at their own pace.

For example, imagine we have a table `player` which stores information about our players:

<!-- TODO: switchable language widget with C# version of below code. -->

```rust
#[spacetimedb::table(name = character, public)]
pub struct Character {
    #[primary_key]
    player_id: Identity,
    #[unique]
    nickname: String,
    level: u32,
    class: Class,
}

#[derive(SpacetimeType, Debug, Copy, Clone)]
pub enum Class {
    Fighter,
    Caster,
    Medic,
}
```

We'll write a few helper functions and some simple reducers:

```rust
#[spacetimedb::reducer]
fn create_character(ctx: &ReducerContext, class: Class, nickname: String) {
    log::info!(
        "Creating new level 1 {class:?} named {nickname}",
    );
    ctx.db.character().insert(Character {
        player_id: ctx.sender,
        nickname,
        level: 1,
        class,
    });
}

fn find_character_for_player(ctx: &ReducerContext) -> Character {
    ctx.db
        .character()
        .player_id()
        .find(ctx.sender)
        .expect("Player has not created a character")
}

fn update_character(ctx: &ReducerContext, character: Character) {
    ctx.db.character().player_id().update(character);
}

#[spacetimedb::reducer]
fn rename_character(ctx: &ReducerContext, new_name: String) {
    let character = find_character_for_player(ctx);
    log::info!(
        "Renaming {} to {}",
        character.nickname,
        new_name,
    );
    update_character(
        ctx,
        Character {
            nickname: new_name,
            ..character
        },
    );
}

#[spacetimedb::reducer]
fn level_up_character(ctx: &ReducerContext) {
    let character = find_character_for_player(ctx);
    log::info!(
        "Leveling up {} from {} to {}",
        character.nickname,
        character.level,
        character.level + 1,
    );
    update_character(
        ctx,
        Character {
            level: character.level + 1,
            ..character
        },
    );
}
```

We'll play around a bit with `spacetime call` to set up a character:

```sh
$ spacetime logs incr-migration-demo -f &

$ spacetime call incr-migration-demo create_character '{ "Fighter": {} }' "Phoebe"

2025-01-07T15:32:57.447286Z  INFO: src/lib.rs:21: Creating new level 1 Fighter named Phoebe

$ spacetime call -s local incr-migration-demo rename_character "Gefjon"

2025-01-07T15:33:48.966134Z  INFO: src/lib.rs:48: Renaming Phoebe to Gefjon

$ spacetime call -s local incr-migration-demo level_up_character

2025-01-07T15:34:01.437495Z  INFO: src/lib.rs:66: Leveling up Gefjon from 1 to 2

$ spacetime sql incr-migration-demo 'SELECT * FROM character'

 player_id | nickname | level | class
-----------+----------+-------+----------------
 <snip>    | "Gefjon" | 2     | (Fighter = ()) 
```

See [the SATS JSON reference](/docs/sats-json) for more on the encoding of arguments to `spacetime call`.

Now we want to add a new feature: each player should be able to align themselves with the forces of good or evil, so we can get some healthy competition going between our players. We'll start each character off with `Alliance::Neutral`, and then offer them a reducer `choose_alliance` to set it to either `Alliance::Good` or `Alliance::Evil`. Our first attempt will be to add a new column to the type `Character`:

```rust
#[spacetimedb::table(name = character, public)]
struct Character {
    #[primary_key]
    player_id: Identity,
    nickname: String,
    level: u32,
    class: Class,
    alliance: Alliance,
}

#[derive(SpacetimeType, Debug, Copy, Clone)]
enum Alliance {
    Good,
    Neutral,
    Evil,
}

#[spacetimedb::reducer]
fn choose_alliance(ctx: &ReducerContext, alliance: Alliance) {
    let character = find_character_for_player(ctx);
    log::info!(
        "Setting {}'s alliance to {:?} for player {}",
        character.nickname,
        alliance,
        ctx.sender,
    );
    update_character(
        ctx,
        Character {
            alliance,
            ..character
        },
    );
}
```

But that will fail, since SpacetimeDB doesn't know how to update our existing `character` rows with the new column:

```
Error: Database update rejected: Errors occurred:
Adding a column alliance to table character requires a manual migration
```

Instead, we'll add a new table, `character_v2`, which will coexist with our original `character` table:

```rust
#[spacetimedb::table(name = character_v2, public)]
struct CharacterV2 {
    #[primary_key]
    player_id: Identity,
    nickname: String,
    level: u32,
    class: Class,
    alliance: Alliance,
}
```

When a new player creates a character, we'll make rows in both tables for them. This way, any old clients that are still subscribing to the original `character` table will continue to work, though of course they won't know about the character's alliance.

```rust
#[spacetimedb::reducer]
fn create_character(ctx: &ReducerContext, class: Class, nickname: String) {
    log::info!(
        "Creating new level 1 {class:?} named {nickname} for player {}",
        ctx.sender,
    );

    ctx.db.character().insert(Character {
        player_id: ctx.sender,
        nickname: nickname.clone(),
        level: 1,
        class,
    });

    ctx.db.character_v2().insert(CharacterV2 {
        player_id: ctx.sender,
        nickname,
        level: 1,
        class,
        alliance: Alliance::Neutral,
    });
}
```

We'll update our helper functions so that they operate on `character_v2` rows. In `find_character_for_player`, if we don't see the player's row in `character_v2`, we'll migrate it from `character` on the fly. In this case, we'll make the player neutral, since they haven't chosen an alliance yet.

```rust
fn find_character_for_player(ctx: &ReducerContext) -> CharacterV2 {
    if let Some(character) = ctx.db.character_v2().player_id().find(ctx.sender) {
        // Already migrated; just return the new player.
        return character;
    }

    // Not yet migrated; look up an old character and update it.
    let old_character = ctx
        .db
        .character()
        .player_id()
        .find(ctx.sender)
        .expect("Player has not created a character");

    ctx.db.character_v2().insert(CharacterV2 {
        player_id: old_character.player_id,
        nickname: old_character.nickname,
        level: old_character.level,
        class: old_character.class,
        alliance: Alliance::Neutral,
    })
}
```

Just like when creating a new character, when we update a `character_v2` row, we'll also update the old `character` row, so that outdated clients can continue to function. It's very important that we perform the same translation between `character` and `character_v2` rows here as in `create_character` and `find_character_for_player`.

```rust
fn update_character(ctx: &ReducerContext, character: CharacterV2) {
    ctx.db.character().player_id().update(Character {
        player_id: character.player_id,
        nickname: character.nickname.clone(),
        level: character.level,
        class: character.class,
    });
    ctx.db.character_v2().player_id().update(character);
}
```

Then we can make trivial modifications to the callers of `update_character` so that they pass in `CharacterV2` instances:

```rust
#[spacetimedb::reducer]
fn rename_character(ctx: &ReducerContext, new_name: String) {
    let character = find_character_for_player(ctx);
    log::info!(
        "Renaming {} to {}",
        character.nickname,
        new_name,
    );
    update_character(
        ctx,
        CharacterV2 {
            nickname: new_name,
            ..character
        },
    );
}

#[spacetimedb::reducer]
fn level_up_character(ctx: &ReducerContext) {
    let character = find_character_for_player(ctx);
    log::info!(
        "Leveling up {} from {} to {}",
        character.nickname,
        character.level,
        character.level + 1,
    );
    update_character(
        ctx,
        CharacterV2 {
            level: character.level + 1,
            ..character
        },
    );
}
```

And finally, we can define our new `choose_alliance` reducer:

```rust
#[spacetimedb::reducer]
fn choose_alliance(ctx: &ReducerContext, alliance: Alliance) {
    let character = find_character_for_player(ctx);
    log::info!(
        "Setting alliance of {} to {:?}",
        character.nickname,
        alliance,
    );
    update_character(
        ctx,
        CharacterV2 {
            alliance,
            ..character
        },
    );
}
```

A bit more playing around with the CLI will show us that everything works as intended:

```sh
# Our row in `character` still exists:
$ spacetime sql incr-migration-demo 'SELECT * FROM character'

 player_id | nickname | level | class
-----------+----------+-------+----------------
 <snip>    | "Gefjon" | 2     | (Fighter = ())

# We haven't triggered the "Gefjon" row to migrate yet, so `character_v2` is empty:
$ spacetime sql -s local incr-migration-demo 'SELECT * FROM character_v2'

 player_id | nickname | level | class | alliance
-----------+----------+-------+-------+----------

# Accessing our character, e.g. by leveling up, will cause it to migrate into `character_v2`:
$ spacetime call incr-migration-demo level_up_character

2025-01-07T16:00:20.500600Z  INFO: src/lib.rs:110: Leveling up Gefjon from 2 to 3

# Now `character_v2` is populated:
$ spacetime sql incr-migration-demo 'SELECT * FROM character_v2'

 player_id | nickname | level | class          | alliance
-----------+----------+-------+----------------+----------------
 <snip>    | "Gefjon" | 3     | (Fighter = ()) | (Neutral = ()) 

# The original row in `character` still got updated by `level_up_character`,
# so outdated clients can continue to function:
$ spacetime sql incr-migration-demo 'SELECT * FROM character'

 player_id | nickname | level | class
-----------+----------+-------+----------------
 <snip>    | "Gefjon" | 3     | (Fighter = ())

# We can set our alliance:
$ spacetime call incr-migration-demo choose_alliance '{ "Good": {} }'

2025-01-07T16:13:53.816501Z  INFO: src/lib.rs:129: Setting alliance of Gefjon to Good

# And that change shows up in `character_v2`:
$ spacetime sql incr-migration-demo 'SELECT * FROM character_v2'

 player_id | nickname | level | class          | alliance
-----------+----------+-------+----------------+-------------
 <snip>    | "Gefjon" | 3     | (Fighter = ()) | (Good = ())

# But `character` is not changed, since it doesn't know about alliances:
$ spacetime sql incr-migration-demo 'SELECT * FROM character'

 player_id | nickname | level | class
-----------+----------+-------+----------------
 <snip>    | "Gefjon" | 3     | (Fighter = ())
```

Now that we know how to define incremental migrations, we can add new features that would seem to require breaking schema changes without cumbersome external migration tools and while maintaining compatibility of outdated clients!
