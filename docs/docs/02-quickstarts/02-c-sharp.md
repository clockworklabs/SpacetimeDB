# Quickstart Chat App

In this tutorial, we'll implement a simple chat server as a SpacetimeDB module.

A SpacetimeDB module is code that gets compiled to WebAssembly and is uploaded to SpacetimeDB. This code becomes server-side logic that interfaces directly with the Spacetime relational database.

Each SpacetimeDB module defines a set of tables and a set of reducers.

Each table is defined as a C# `class` annotated with `[SpacetimeDB.Table]`, where an instance represents a row, and each field represents a column.
By default, tables are **private**. This means that they are only readable by the table owner, and by server module code.
The `[SpacetimeDB.Table(Public = true))]` annotation makes a table public. **Public** tables are readable by all users, but can still only be modified by your server module code.

A reducer is a function which traverses and updates the database. Each reducer call runs in its own transaction, and its updates to the database are only committed if the reducer returns successfully. In C#, reducers are defined as functions annotated with `[SpacetimeDB.Reducer]`. If an exception is thrown, the reducer call fails, the database is not updated, and a failed message is reported to the client.

## Install SpacetimeDB

If you haven't already, start by [installing SpacetimeDB](pathname:///install). This will install the `spacetime` command line interface (CLI), which contains all the functionality for interacting with SpacetimeDB.

<InstallCardLink />

## Install .NET 8

Next we need to [install .NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) so that we can build and publish our module.

You may already have .NET 8 and can be checked:

```bash
dotnet --list-sdks
```

.NET 8.0 is the earliest to have the `wasi-experimental` workload that we rely on, but requires manual activation:

```bash
dotnet workload install wasi-experimental
```

## Project structure

Create and enter a directory `quickstart-chat`:

```bash
mkdir quickstart-chat
cd quickstart-chat
```

Now create `server`, our module, which runs in the database:

```bash
spacetime init --lang csharp server
```

## Declare imports

`spacetime init` generated a few files:

1. Open `server/StdbModule.csproj` to generate a .sln file for intellisense/validation support.
2. Open `server/Lib.cs`, a trivial module.
3. Clear it out, so we can write a new module that's still pretty simple: a bare-bones chat server.

To start, we'll need to add `SpacetimeDB` to our using statements. This will give us access to everything we need to author our SpacetimeDB server module.

To the top of `server/Lib.cs`, add some imports we'll be using:

```csharp
using SpacetimeDB;
```

We also need to create our static module class which all of the module code will live in. In `server/Lib.cs`, add:

```csharp
public static partial class Module
{
}
```

## Define tables

To get our chat server running, we'll need to store two kinds of data: information about each user, and records of all the messages that have been sent.

For each `User`, we'll store their `Identity`, an optional name they can set to identify themselves to other users, and whether they're online or not. We'll designate the `Identity` as our primary key, which enforces that it must be unique, indexes it for faster lookup, and allows clients to track updates.

In `server/Lib.cs`, add the definition of the table `User` to the `Module` class:

```csharp
[Table(Name = "user", Public = true)]
public partial class User
{
    [PrimaryKey]
    public Identity Identity;
    public string? Name;
    public bool Online;
}
```

For each `Message`, we'll store the `Identity` of the user who sent it, the `Timestamp` when it was sent, and the text of the message.

In `server/Lib.cs`, add the definition of the table `Message` to the `Module` class:

```csharp
[Table(Name = "message", Public = true)]
public partial class Message
{
    public Identity Sender;
    public Timestamp Sent;
    public string Text = "";
}
```

## Set users' names

We want to allow users to set their names, because `Identity` is not a terribly user-friendly identifier. To that effect, we define a reducer `SetName` which clients can invoke to set their `User.Name`. It will validate the caller's chosen name, using a function `ValidateName` which we'll define next, then look up the `User` record for the caller and update it to store the validated name. If the name fails the validation, the reducer will fail.

Each reducer must accept as its first argument a `ReducerContext`, which includes contextual data such as the `Sender` which contains the Identity of the client that called the reducer, and the `Timestamp` when it was invoked. For now, we only need the `Sender`.

It's also possible to call `SetName` via the SpacetimeDB CLI's `spacetime call` command without a connection, in which case no `User` record will exist for the caller. We'll return an error in this case, but you could alter the reducer to insert a `User` row for the module owner. You'll have to decide whether the module owner is always online or always offline, though.

In `server/Lib.cs`, add to the `Module` class:

```csharp
[Reducer]
public static void SetName(ReducerContext ctx, string name)
{
    name = ValidateName(name);

    if (ctx.Db.user.Identity.Find(ctx.Sender) is User user)
    {
        user.Name = name;
        ctx.Db.user.Identity.Update(user);
    }
}
```

For now, we'll just do a bare minimum of validation, rejecting the empty name. You could extend this in various ways, like:

- Comparing against a blacklist for moderation purposes.
- Unicode-normalizing names.
- Rejecting names that contain non-printable characters, or removing characters or replacing them with a placeholder.
- Rejecting or truncating long names.
- Rejecting duplicate names.

In `server/Lib.cs`, add to the `Module` class:

```csharp
/// Takes a name and checks if it's acceptable as a user's name.
private static string ValidateName(string name)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
    {
        throw new Exception("Names must not be empty");
    }
    return name;
}
```

## Send messages

We define a reducer `SendMessage`, which clients will call to send messages. It will validate the message's text, then insert a new `Message` record using `Message.Insert`, with the `Sender` identity and `Time` timestamp taken from the `ReducerContext`.

In `server/Lib.cs`, add to the `Module` class:

```csharp
[Reducer]
public static void SendMessage(ReducerContext ctx, string text)
{
    text = ValidateMessage(text);
    Log.Info(text);
    ctx.Db.message.Insert(
        new Message
        {
            Sender = ctx.Sender,
            Text = text,
            Sent = ctx.Timestamp,
        }
    );
}
```

We'll want to validate messages' texts in much the same way we validate users' chosen names. As above, we'll do the bare minimum, rejecting only empty messages.

In `server/Lib.cs`, add to the `Module` class:

```csharp
/// Takes a message's text and checks if it's acceptable to send.
private static string ValidateMessage(string text)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(text))
    {
        throw new ArgumentException("Messages must not be empty");
    }
    return text;
}
```

You could extend the validation in `ValidateMessage` in similar ways to `ValidateName`, or add additional checks to `SendMessage`, like:

- Rejecting messages from senders who haven't set their names.
- Rate-limiting users so they can't send new messages too quickly.

## Set users' online status

In C# modules, you can register for `Connect` and `Disconnect` events by using a special `ReducerKind`. We'll use the `Connect` event to create a `User` record for the client if it doesn't yet exist, and to set its online status.

We'll use `reducerContext.Db.User.Identity.Find` to look up a `User` row for `ctx.Sender`, if one exists. If we find one, we'll use `reducerContext.Db.User.Identity.Update` to overwrite it with a row that has `Online: true`. If not, we'll use `User.Insert` to insert a new row for our new user. All three of these methods are generated by the `[SpacetimeDB.Table]` attribute, with rows and behavior based on the row attributes. `User.Identity.Find` returns a nullable `User`, because the unique constraint from the `[PrimaryKey]` attribute means there will be either zero or one matching rows. `Insert` will throw an exception if the insert violates this constraint; if we want to overwrite a `User` row, we need to do so explicitly using `User.Identity.Update`.

In `server/Lib.cs`, add the definition of the connect reducer to the `Module` class:

```csharp
[Reducer(ReducerKind.ClientConnected)]
public static void ClientConnected(ReducerContext ctx)
{
    Log.Info($"Connect {ctx.Sender}");

    if (ctx.Db.user.Identity.Find(ctx.Sender) is User user)
    {
        // If this is a returning user, i.e., we already have a `User` with this `Identity`,
        // set `Online: true`, but leave `Name` and `Identity` unchanged.
        user.Online = true;
        ctx.Db.user.Identity.Update(user);
    }
    else
    {
        // If this is a new user, create a `User` object for the `Identity`,
        // which is online, but hasn't set a name.
        ctx.Db.user.Insert(
            new User
            {
                Name = null,
                Identity = ctx.Sender,
                Online = true,
            }
        );
    }
}
```

Similarly, whenever a client disconnects, the database will execute the `OnDisconnect` event if it's registered with `ReducerKind.ClientDisconnected`. We'll use it to un-set the `Online` status of the `User` for the disconnected client.

Add the following code after the `OnConnect` handler:

```csharp
[Reducer(ReducerKind.ClientDisconnected)]
public static void ClientDisconnected(ReducerContext ctx)
{
    if (ctx.Db.user.Identity.Find(ctx.Sender) is User user)
    {
        // This user should exist, so set `Online: false`.
        user.Online = false;
        ctx.Db.user.Identity.Update(user);
    }
    else
    {
        // User does not exist, log warning
        Log.Warn("Warning: No user found for disconnected client.");
    }
}
```

## Start the Server

If you haven't already started the SpacetimeDB server, run the `spacetime start` command in a _separate_ terminal and leave it running while you continue following along.

## Publish the module

And that's all of our module code! We'll run `spacetime publish` to compile our module and publish it on SpacetimeDB. `spacetime publish` takes an optional name which will map to the database's unique address. Clients can connect either by name or by address, but names are much more pleasant. In this example, we'll be using `quickstart-chat`. Feel free to come up with a unique name, and in the CLI commands, replace where we've written `quickstart-chat` with the name you chose.

From the `quickstart-chat` directory, run:

```bash
spacetime publish --project-path server quickstart-chat
```

Note: If the WebAssembly optimizer `wasm-opt` is installed, `spacetime publish` will automatically optimize the Web Assembly output of the published module. Instruction for installing the `wasm-opt` binary can be found in [Rust's wasm-opt documentation](https://docs.rs/wasm-opt/latest/wasm_opt/).

## Call Reducers

You can use the CLI (command line interface) to run reducers. The arguments to the reducer are passed in JSON format.

```bash
spacetime call quickstart-chat SendMessage "Hello, World!"
```

Once we've called our `SendMessage` reducer, we can check to make sure it ran by running the `logs` command.

```bash
spacetime logs quickstart-chat
```

You should now see the output that your module printed in the database.

```bash
info: Hello, World!
```

## SQL Queries

SpacetimeDB supports a subset of the SQL syntax so that you can easily query the data of your database. We can run a query using the `sql` command.

```bash
spacetime sql quickstart-chat "SELECT * FROM message"
```

```bash
 sender                                                             | sent                             | text
--------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+-----------------
 0x93dda09db9a56d8fa6c024d843e805d8262191db3b4ba84c5efcd1ad451fed4e | 2025-04-08T15:47:46.935402+00:00 | "Hello, world!"
```

You've just set up your first database in SpacetimeDB! You can find the full code for this module [in the C# server module example](https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB/tree/master/sdks/csharp/examples~/quickstart-chat/server).


# Creating the client 
Next, we'll show you how to get up and running with a simple SpacetimeDB app with a client written in C#.

We'll implement a command-line client for the module created in our [Rust](/docs/quickstarts/rust) or [C# Module](/docs/quickstarts/c-sharp) Quickstart guides. Ensure you followed one of these guides before continuing.

## Project structure

Enter the directory `quickstart-chat` you created in the [Rust Module Quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/rust) or [C# Module Quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/c-sharp) guides:

```bash
cd quickstart-chat
```

Within it, create a new C# console application project called `client` using either Visual Studio, Rider or the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet new console -o client
```

Open the project in your IDE of choice.

## Add the NuGet package for the C# SpacetimeDB SDK

Add the `SpacetimeDB.ClientSDK` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpacetimeDB.ClientSDK/) using Visual Studio or Rider _NuGet Package Manager_ or via the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package SpacetimeDB.ClientSDK
```

## Clear `client/Program.cs`

Clear out any data from `client/Program.cs` so we can write our chat client.

## Generate your module types

The `spacetime` CLI's `generate` command will generate client-side interfaces for the tables, reducers and types defined in your server module.

In your `quickstart-chat` directory, run:

```bash
mkdir -p client/module_bindings
spacetime generate --lang csharp --out-dir client/module_bindings --project-path server
```

Take a look inside `client/module_bindings`. The CLI should have generated three folders and nine files:

```
module_bindings
├── Reducers
│   ├── ClientConnected.g.cs
│   ├── ClientDisconnected.g.cs
│   ├── SendMessage.g.cs
│   └── SetName.g.cs
├── Tables
│   ├── Message.g.cs
│   └── User.g.cs
├── Types
│   ├── Message.g.cs
│   └── User.g.cs
└── SpacetimeDBClient.g.cs
```

## Add imports to Program.cs

Open `client/Program.cs` and add the following imports:

```csharp
using SpacetimeDB;
using SpacetimeDB.Types;
using System.Collections.Concurrent;
```

We will also need to create some global variables. We'll cover the `Identity` later in the `Save credentials` section. Later we'll also be setting up a second thread for handling user input. In the `Process thread` section we'll use this in the `ConcurrentQueue` to store the commands for that thread.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
// our local client SpacetimeDB identity
Identity? local_identity = null;

// declare a thread safe queue to store commands
var input_queue = new ConcurrentQueue<(string Command, string Args)>();
```

## Define Main function

We'll work outside-in, first defining our `Main` function at a high level, then implementing each behavior it needs. We need `Main` to do several things:

1. Initialize the `AuthToken` module, which loads and stores our authentication token to/from local storage.
2. Connect to the database.
3. Register a number of callbacks to run in response to various database events.
4. Start our processing thread which connects to the SpacetimeDB database, updates the SpacetimeDB client and processes commands that come in from the input loop running in the main thread.
5. Start the input loop, which reads commands from standard input and sends them to the processing thread.
6. When the input loop exits, stop the processing thread and wait for it to exit.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
void Main()
{
    // Initialize the `AuthToken` module
    AuthToken.Init(".spacetime_csharp_quickstart");
    // Builds and connects to the database
    DbConnection? conn = null;
    conn = ConnectToDB();
    // Registers to run in response to database events.
    RegisterCallbacks(conn);
    // Declare a threadsafe cancel token to cancel the process loop
    var cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
    // Spawn a thread to call process updates and process commands
    var thread = new Thread(() => ProcessThread(conn, cancellationTokenSource.Token));
    thread.Start();
    // Handles CLI input
    InputLoop();
    // This signals the ProcessThread to stop
    cancellationTokenSource.Cancel();
    thread.Join();
}
```

## Connect to database

Before we connect, we'll store the SpacetimeDB hostname and our database name in constants `HOST` and `DB_NAME`.

A connection to a SpacetimeDB database is represented by a `DbConnection`. We configure `DbConnection`s using the builder pattern, by calling `DbConnection.Builder()`, chaining method calls to set various connection parameters and register callbacks, then we cap it off with a call to `.Build()` to begin the connection.

In our case, we'll supply the following options:

1. A `WithUri` call, to specify the URI of the SpacetimeDB host where our database is running.
2. A `WithModuleName` call, to specify the name or `Identity` of our database. Make sure to pass the same name here as you supplied to `spacetime publish`.
3. A `WithToken` call, to supply a token to authenticate with.
4. An `OnConnect` callback, to run when the remote database acknowledges and accepts our connection.
5. An `OnConnectError` callback, to run if the remote database is unreachable or it rejects our connection.
6. An `OnDisconnect` callback, to run when our connection ends.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
/// The URI of the SpacetimeDB instance hosting our chat database and module.
const string HOST = "http://localhost:3000";

/// The database name we chose when we published our module.
const string DB_NAME = "quickstart-chat";

/// Load credentials from a file and connect to the database.
DbConnection ConnectToDB()
{
    DbConnection? conn = null;
    conn = DbConnection.Builder()
        .WithUri(HOST)
        .WithModuleName(DB_NAME)
        .WithToken(AuthToken.Token)
        .OnConnect(OnConnected)
        .OnConnectError(OnConnectError)
        .OnDisconnect(OnDisconnected)
        .Build();
    return conn;
}
```

### Save credentials

SpacetimeDB will accept any [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) compliant [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) and use it to compute an `Identity` for the user. More complex applications will generally authenticate their user somehow, generate or retrieve a token, and attach it to their connection via `WithToken`. In our case, though, we'll connect anonymously the first time, let SpacetimeDB generate a fresh `Identity` and corresponding JWT for us, and save that token locally to re-use the next time we connect.

Once we are connected, we'll use the `AuthToken` module to save our token to local storage, so that we can re-authenticate as the same user the next time we connect. We'll also store the identity in a global variable `local_identity` so that we can use it to check if we are the sender of a message or name change. This callback also notifies us of our client's `Address`, an opaque identifier SpacetimeDB modules can use to distinguish connections by the same `Identity`, but we won't use it in our app.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
/// Our `OnConnected` callback: save our credentials to a file.
void OnConnected(DbConnection conn, Identity identity, string authToken)
{
    local_identity = identity;
    AuthToken.SaveToken(authToken);
}
```

### Connect Error callback

Should we get an error during connection, we'll be given an `Exception` which contains the details about the exception. To keep things simple, we'll just write the exception to the console.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
/// Our `OnConnectError` callback: print the error, then exit the process.
void OnConnectError(Exception e)
{
    Console.Write($"Error while connecting: {e}");
}
```

### Disconnect callback

When disconnecting, the callback contains the connection details and if an error occurs, it will also contain an `Exception`. If we get an error, we'll write the error to the console, if not, we'll just write that we disconnected.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
/// Our `OnDisconnect` callback: print a note, then exit the process.
void OnDisconnected(DbConnection conn, Exception? e)
{
    if (e != null)
    {
        Console.Write($"Disconnected abnormally: {e}");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.Write($"Disconnected normally.");
    }
}
```

## Register callbacks

Now we need to handle several sorts of events with Tables and Reducers:

1. `User.OnInsert`: When a new user joins, we'll print a message introducing them.
2. `User.OnUpdate`: When a user is updated, we'll print their new name, or declare their new online status.
3. `Message.OnInsert`: When we receive a new message, we'll print it.
4. `Reducer.OnSetName`: If the server rejects our attempt to set our name, we'll print an error.
5. `Reducer.OnSendMessage`: If the server rejects a message we send, we'll print an error.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
/// Register all the callbacks our app will use to respond to database events.
void RegisterCallbacks(DbConnection conn)
{
    conn.Db.User.OnInsert += User_OnInsert;
    conn.Db.User.OnUpdate += User_OnUpdate;

    conn.Db.Message.OnInsert += Message_OnInsert;

    conn.Reducers.OnSetName += Reducer_OnSetNameEvent;
    conn.Reducers.OnSendMessage += Reducer_OnSendMessageEvent;
}
```

### Notify about new users

For each table, we can register on-insert and on-delete callbacks to be run whenever a subscribed row is inserted or deleted. We register these callbacks using the `OnInsert` and `OnDelete` methods, which are automatically generated for each table by `spacetime generate`.

These callbacks can fire in two contexts:

- After a reducer runs, when the client's cache is updated about changes to subscribed rows.
- After calling `subscribe`, when the client's cache is initialized with all existing matching rows.

This second case means that, even though the module only ever inserts online users, the client's `User.OnInsert` callbacks may be invoked with users who are offline. We'll only notify about online users.

`OnInsert` and `OnDelete` callbacks take two arguments: an `EventContext` and the altered row. The `EventContext.Event` is an enum which describes the event that caused the row to be inserted or deleted. All SpacetimeDB callbacks accept a context argument, which you can use in place of your top-level `DbConnection`.

Whenever we want to print a user, if they have set a name, we'll use that. If they haven't set a name, we'll instead print the first 8 bytes of their identity, encoded as hexadecimal. We'll define a function `UserNameOrIdentity` to handle this.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
/// If the user has no set name, use the first 8 characters from their identity.
string UserNameOrIdentity(User user) => user.Name ?? user.Identity.ToString()[..8];

/// Our `User.OnInsert` callback: if the user is online, print a notification.
void User_OnInsert(EventContext ctx, User insertedValue)
{
    if (insertedValue.Online)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{UserNameOrIdentity(insertedValue)} is online");
    }
}
```

### Notify about updated users

Because we declared a primary key column in our `User` table, we can also register on-update callbacks. These run whenever a row is replaced by a row with the same primary key, like our module's `User.Identity.Update` calls. We register these callbacks using the `OnUpdate` method, which is automatically implemented by `spacetime generate` for any table with a primary key column.

`OnUpdate` callbacks take three arguments: the old row, the new row, and a `EventContext`.

In our module, users can be updated for three reasons:

1. They've set their name using the `SetName` reducer.
2. They're an existing user re-connecting, so their `Online` has been set to `true`.
3. They've disconnected, so their `Online` has been set to `false`.

We'll print an appropriate message in each of these cases.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
/// Our `User.OnUpdate` callback:
/// print a notification about name and status changes.
void User_OnUpdate(EventContext ctx, User oldValue, User newValue)
{
    if (oldValue.Name != newValue.Name)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{UserNameOrIdentity(oldValue)} renamed to {newValue.Name}");
    }
    if (oldValue.Online != newValue.Online)
    {
        if (newValue.Online)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{UserNameOrIdentity(newValue)} connected.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{UserNameOrIdentity(newValue)} disconnected.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Print messages

When we receive a new message, we'll print it to standard output, along with the name of the user who sent it. Keep in mind that we only want to do this for new messages, i.e. those inserted by a `SendMessage` reducer invocation. We have to handle the backlog we receive when our subscription is initialized separately, to ensure they're printed in the correct order. To that effect, our `OnInsert` callback will check if its `ReducerEvent` argument is not `null`, and only print in that case.

To find the `User` based on the message's `Sender` identity, we'll use `User.Identity.Find`, which behaves like the same function on the server.

We'll print the user's name or identity in the same way as we did when notifying about `User` table events, but here we have to handle the case where we don't find a matching `User` row. This can happen when the module owner sends a message using the CLI's `spacetime call`. In this case, we'll print `unknown`.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
/// Our `Message.OnInsert` callback: print new messages.
void Message_OnInsert(EventContext ctx, Message insertedValue)
{
    // We are filtering out messages inserted during the subscription being applied,
    // since we will be printing those in the OnSubscriptionApplied callback,
    // where we will be able to first sort the messages before printing.
    if (ctx.Event is not Event<Reducer>.SubscribeApplied)
    {
        PrintMessage(ctx.Db, insertedValue);
    }
}

void PrintMessage(RemoteTables tables, Message message)
{
    var sender = tables.User.Identity.Find(message.Sender);
    var senderName = "unknown";
    if (sender != null)
    {
        senderName = UserNameOrIdentity(sender);
    }

    Console.WriteLine($"{senderName}: {message.Text}");
}
```

### Warn if our name was rejected

We can also register callbacks to run each time a reducer is invoked. We register these callbacks using the `OnReducerEvent` method of the `Reducer` namespace, which is automatically implemented for each reducer by `spacetime generate`.

Each reducer callback takes one fixed argument:

The `ReducerEventContext` of the callback, which contains an `Event` that contains several fields. The ones we care about are:

1. The `CallerIdentity`, the `Identity` of the client that called the reducer.
2. The `Status` of the reducer run, one of `Committed`, `Failed` or `OutOfEnergy`.
3. If we get a `Status.Failed`, an error message is nested inside that we'll want to write to the console.

It also takes a variable amount of additional arguments that match the reducer's arguments.

These callbacks will be invoked in one of two cases:

1. If the reducer was successful and altered any of our subscribed rows.
2. If we requested an invocation which failed.

Note that a status of `Failed` or `OutOfEnergy` implies that the caller identity is our own identity.

We already handle successful `SetName` invocations using our `User.OnUpdate` callback, but if the module rejects a user's chosen name, we'd like that user's client to let them know. We define a function `Reducer_OnSetNameEvent` as a `Reducer.OnSetNameEvent` callback which checks if the reducer failed, and if it did, prints an error message including the rejected name.

We'll test both that our identity matches the sender and that the status is `Failed`, even though the latter implies the former, for demonstration purposes.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
/// Our `OnSetNameEvent` callback: print a warning if the reducer failed.
void Reducer_OnSetNameEvent(ReducerEventContext ctx, string name)
{
    var e = ctx.Event;
    if (e.CallerIdentity == local_identity && e.Status is Status.Failed(var error))
    {
        Console.Write($"Failed to change name to {name}: {error}");
    }
}
```

### Warn if our message was rejected

We handle warnings on rejected messages the same way as rejected names, though the types and the error message are different.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
/// Our `OnSendMessageEvent` callback: print a warning if the reducer failed.
void Reducer_OnSendMessageEvent(ReducerEventContext ctx, string text)
{
    var e = ctx.Event;
    if (e.CallerIdentity == local_identity && e.Status is Status.Failed(var error))
    {
        Console.Write($"Failed to send message {text}: {error}");
    }
}
```

## Subscribe to queries

SpacetimeDB is set up so that each client subscribes via SQL queries to some subset of the database, and is notified about changes only to that subset. For complex apps with large databases, judicious subscriptions can save each client significant network bandwidth, memory and computation. For example, in [BitCraft](https://bitcraftonline.com), each player's client subscribes only to the entities in the "chunk" of the world where that player currently resides, rather than the entire game world. Our app is much simpler than BitCraft, so we'll just subscribe to the whole database using `SubscribeToAllTables`.

You can also subscribe to specific tables using SQL syntax, e.g. `SELECT * FROM my_table`. Our [SQL documentation](/sql) enumerates the operations that are accepted in our SQL syntax.

When we specify our subscriptions, we can supply an `OnApplied` callback. This will run when the subscription is applied and the matching rows become available in our client cache. We'll use this opportunity to print the message backlog in proper order.

We can also provide an `OnError` callback. This will run if the subscription fails, usually due to an invalid or malformed SQL queries. We can't handle this case, so we'll just print out the error and exit the process.

In `Program.cs`, update our `OnConnected` function to include `conn.SubscriptionBuilder().OnApplied(OnSubscriptionApplied).SubscribeToAllTables();` so that it reads:

```csharp
/// Our `OnConnect` callback: save our credentials to a file.
void OnConnected(DbConnection conn, Identity identity, string authToken)
{
    local_identity = identity;
    AuthToken.SaveToken(authToken);

    conn.SubscriptionBuilder()
        .OnApplied(OnSubscriptionApplied)
        .SubscribeToAllTables();
}
```

## OnSubscriptionApplied callback

Once our subscription is applied, we'll print all the previously sent messages. We'll define a function `PrintMessagesInOrder` to do this. `PrintMessagesInOrder` calls the automatically generated `Iter` function on our `Message` table, which returns an iterator over all rows in the table. We'll use the `OrderBy` method on the iterator to sort the messages by their `Sent` timestamp.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
/// Our `OnSubscriptionApplied` callback:
/// sort all past messages and print them in timestamp order.
void OnSubscriptionApplied(SubscriptionEventContext ctx)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Connected");
    PrintMessagesInOrder(ctx.Db);
}

void PrintMessagesInOrder(RemoteTables tables)
{
    foreach (Message message in tables.Message.Iter().OrderBy(item => item.Sent))
    {
        PrintMessage(tables, message);
    }
}
```

## Process thread

Since the input loop will be blocking, we'll run our processing code in a separate thread.

This thread will loop until the thread is signaled to exit, calling the update function `FrameTick` on the `DbConnection` to process any updates received from the database, and `ProcessCommand` to process any commands received from the input loop.

Afterward, close the connection to the database.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
/// Our separate thread from main, where we can call process updates and process commands without blocking the main thread.
void ProcessThread(DbConnection conn, CancellationToken ct)
{
    try
    {
        // loop until cancellation token
        while (!ct.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            conn.FrameTick();

            ProcessCommands(conn.Reducers);

            Thread.Sleep(100);
        }
    }
    finally
    {
        conn.Disconnect();
    }
}
```

## Handle user input

The input loop will read commands from standard input and send them to the processing thread using the input queue. The `ProcessCommands` function is called every 100ms by the processing thread to process any pending commands.

Supported Commands:

1. Send a message: `message`, send the message to the database by calling `Reducer.SendMessage` which is automatically generated by `spacetime generate`.

2. Set name: `name`, will send the new name to the database by calling `Reducer.SetName` which is automatically generated by `spacetime generate`.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
/// Read each line of standard input, and either set our name or send a message as appropriate.
void InputLoop()
{
    while (true)
    {
        var input = Console.ReadLine();
        if (input == null)
        {
            break;
        }

        if (input.StartsWith("/name "))
        {
            input_queue.Enqueue(("name", input[6..]));
            continue;
        }
        else
        {
            input_queue.Enqueue(("message", input));
        }
    }
}

void ProcessCommands(RemoteReducers reducers)
{
    // process input queue commands
    while (input_queue.TryDequeue(out var command))
    {
        switch (command.Command)
        {
            case "message":
                reducers.SendMessage(command.Args);
                break;
            case "name":
                reducers.SetName(command.Args);
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

## Run the client

Finally, we just need to add a call to `Main`.

To `Program.cs`, add:

```csharp
Main();
```

Now, we can run the client by hitting start in Visual Studio or Rider; or by running the following command in the `client` directory:

```bash
dotnet run --project client
```
