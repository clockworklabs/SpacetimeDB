In this tutorial you'll learn how to build a small-scoped MMORPG in Unity, from scratch, using SpacetimeDB. Although, the game we're going to build is small in scope, it'll scale to hundreds of players and will help you get acquainted with all the features and best practices of SpacetimeDB, while building [a fun little game](https://github.com/ClockworkLabs/Blackholio).

By the end, you should have a basic understanding of what SpacetimeDB offers for developers making multiplayer games. 

The game is inspired by [agar.io](https://agar.io), but SpacetimeDB themed with some fun twists. If you're not familiar [agar.io](https://agar.io), it's a web game in which you and hundreds of other players compete to cultivate mass to become the largest cell in the Petri dish.

Our game, called [Blackhol.io](https://github.com/ClockworkLabs/tree/master/demo/Blackholio), will be similar but space themed. It should give you a great idea of the types of games you can develop easily with SpacetimeDB.

This tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of the Unity Editor, using a command line terminal and programming. We'll give you some CLI commands to execute. If you are using Windows, we recommend using Git Bash or PowerShell. For Mac, we recommend Terminal.

SpacetimeDB supports Unity version `2022.3.32f1` or later, and this tutorial has been tested with the following Unity versions:

- `2022.3.32f1 LTS`
- `6000.0.33f1`

Please file an issue [here](https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB/issues) if you encounter an issue with a specific Unity version, but please be aware that the SpacetimeDB team is unable to offer support for issues related to versions of Unity prior to `2022.3.32f1 LTS`.
