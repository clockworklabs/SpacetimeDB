The dashboard provides you with multiple tabs to manage different aspects of
your project:

- **Overview**: A summary of your project, including a table of recent users.
- **Clients**: A list of all clients (applications) that can be used to
  authenticate in your applications.
  A default client is created for you when you create a new project.
- **Users**: A list of all users in your project, with options to search, filter,
  and manage users.
- **Identity Providers**: A list of all identity providers (e.g. Google, GitHub,
  etc.) that can be used to authenticate users in your project.
- **Customization**: Live editor to customize colors, logos, and authentication methods.
