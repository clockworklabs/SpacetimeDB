# Updating your app for SpacetimeDB v0.12

We're excited to release SpacetimeDB v0.12, which includes a major overhaul of our Rust, C# and TypeScript APIs for both modules and clients. In no particular order, our goals with this rewrite were:

- Our APIs should be as similar as possible in all three languages we support, and in clients and modules, so that you don't have to go to a ton of work figuring out why something works in one place but not somewhere else.
- We should be very explicit about what operations interact with the database and how. In addition to good hygiene, this means that a client can now connect to multiple remote modules at the same time without getting confused. (Some day a module will be able to connect to remote modules too, but we're not there yet.)
- Our APIs should expose low level database operations so you can program your applications to have predictable performance characteristics. An indexed lookup should look different in your code from a full scan, and writing the indexed lookup should be easier. This will help you write your apps as efficiently as possible as we add features to SpacetimeDB. (In the future, as we get more sophisticated at optimizing and evaluating queries, we will offer a higher level logical query API which let's us implement very high performance optimizations and abstract away concerns like indices.)

The new APIs are a significant improvement to the developer experience of SpacetimeDB and enable some amazing features in the future. They're completely new APIs, so if you run into any trouble, please [ask us for help or share your feedback on Discord!](https://discord.gg/spacetimedb)

To start migrating, update your SpacetimeDB CLI, and bump the `spacetimedb` and `spacetimedb-sdk` dependency versions to 0.12 in your module and client respectively.

## Modules

### The reducer context

All your reducers must now accept a reducer context as their first argument. In Rust, this is now taken by reference, as `&ReducerContext`. All access to tables now go through methods on the `db` or `Db` field of the `ReducerContext`.

```rust
#[spacetimedb::reducer]
fn my_reducer(ctx: &ReducerContext) {
    for row in ctx.db.my_table().iter() {
        // Do something with the row...
    }
}
```

```csharp
[SpacetimeDB.Reducer]
public static void MyReducer(ReducerContext ctx) {
    foreach (var row in ctx.Db.MyTable.Iter()) {
        // Do something with the row...
    }
}
```

### Table names and access methods

You now must specify a name for every table, distinct from the type name. In Rust, write this as `#[spacetimedb::table(name = my_table)]`. The name you specify here will be the method on `ctx.db` you use to access the table.

```rust
#[spacetimedb::table(name = my_table)]
struct MyTable {
    #[primary_key]
    #[auto_inc]
    id: u64,
    other_column: u32,
}
```

```csharp
[SpacetimeDB.Table(Name = "MyTable")]
public partial struct MyTable
{
    [SpacetimeDB.PrimaryKey]
    [SpacetimeDB.AutoInc]
    public long Id;
    public int OtherColumn;
}
```

One neat upside of this is that you can now have multiple tables with the same row type!

```rust
#[spacetimedb::table(name = signed_in_user)]
#[spacetimedb::table(name = signed_out_user)]
struct User {
    #[primary_key]
    id: Identity,
    #[unique]
    username: String,
}
```

```csharp
[SpacetimeDB.Table(Name = "SignedInUser")]
[SpacetimeDB.Table(Name = "SignedOutUser")]
public partial struct User
{
    [SpacetimeDB.PrimaryKey]
    public SpacetimeDB.Identity Id;
    [SpacetimeDB.Unique]
    public String Username;
}
```

### Iterating, counting, inserting, deleting

Each "table handle" `ctx.db.my_table()` has methods:

| Rust name | C# name  | Behavior                                |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| `iter`    | `Iter`   | Iterate over all rows in the table.     |
| `count`   | `Count`  | Return the number of rows in the table. |
| `insert`  | `Insert` | Add a new row to the table.             |
| `delete`  | `Delete` | Delete a given row from the table.      |

### Index access

Each table handle also has a method for each BTree index and/or unique constraint on the table, which allows you to filter, delete or update by that index. BTree indices' filter and delete methods accept both point and range queries.

```rust
#[spacetimedb::table(
    name = entity,
    index(name = location, btree = [x, y]),
)]
struct Entity {
    #[primary_key]
    #[auto_inc]
    id: u64,
    x: u32,
    y: u32,
    #[index(btree)]
    faction: String,
}

#[spacetimedb::reducer]
fn move_entity(ctx: &ReducerContext, entity_id: u64, x: u32, y: u32) {
    let entity = ctx.db.entity().id().find(entity_id).expect("No such entity");
    ctx.db.entity.id().update(Entity { x, y, ..entity });
}

#[spacetimedb::reducer]
fn log_entities_at_point(ctx: &ReducerContext, x: u32, y: u32) {
    for entity in ctx.db.entity().location().filter((x, y)) {
        log::info!("Entity {} is at ({}, {})", entity.id, x, y);
    }
}

#[spacetimedb::reducer]
fn delete_faction(ctx: &ReducerContext, faction: String) {
    ctx.db.entity().faction().delete(&faction);
}
```

```csharp
[SpacetimeDB.Table(Name = "Entity")]
[SpacetimeDB.Table(Name = "SignedOutUser")]
[SpacetimeDB.Index(Name = "Location", BTree = ["X", "Y"])]
[SpacetimeDB.Index(Name = "Faction", BTree = ["Faction"])]
public partial struct Entity
{
    [SpacetimeDB.PrimaryKey]
    [SpacetimeDB.AutoInc]
    public long Id;
    public int X;
    public int Y;
    public string Faction;
}

[SpacetimeDB.Reducer]
public static void MoveEntity(SpacetimeDB.ReducerContext ctx, long entityId, int x, int y) {
    var entity = ctx.Db.Entity.Id.Find(entityId);
    ctx.Db.Entity.Id.Update(new Entity {
        Id = entityId,
        X = x,
        Y = y,
        Faction = entity.Faction,
    });
}

[SpacetimeDB.Reducer]
public static void LogEntitiesAtPoint(SpacetimeDB.ReducerContext ctx, int x, int y) {
    foreach(var entity in ctx.Db.Entity.Location.Filter((x, y))) {
        SpacetimeDB.Log.Info($"Entity {entity.Id} is at ({x}, {y})");
    }
}

[SpacetimeDB.Reducer]
public static void DeleteFaction(SpacetimeDB.ReducerContext ctx, string Faction) {
    ctx.Db.Entity.Faction.Delete(Faction);
}
```

### `query`

Note that the `query!` macro in Rust and the `.Query()` method in C# have been removed. We plan to replace them with something even better in the future, but for now, you should write your query explicitly, either by accessing an index or multi-column index by chaining `ctx.db.my_table().iter().filter(|row| predicate)`.

### Built-in reducers

The Rust syntax for declaring builtin lifecycles have changed. They are now:

- `#[spacetimedb::reducer(client_connected)]`
- `#[spacetimedb::reducer(client_disconnected)]`
- `#[spacetimedb::reducer(init)]`

In C# they are now:

- `[SpacetimeDB.Reducer(SpacetimeDB.ReducerKind.ClientConnected)]`
- `[SpacetimeDB.Reducer(SpacetimeDB.ReducerKind.ClientDisconnected)]`
- `[SpacetimeDB.Reducer(SpacetimeDB.ReducerKind.Init)]`

## Clients

Make sure to run `spacetime generate` after updating your module!

### The connection object

Your connection to a remote module is now represented by a `DbConnection` object, which holds all state associated with the connection. We encourage you to name the variable that holds your connection `ctx`.

Construct a `DbConnection` via the [builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) with `DbConnection::builder()` or your language's equivalent. Register on-connect and on-disconnect callbacks while constructing the connection via the builder.

> NOTE: The APIs for the the `DbConnection` and `ReducerContext` are quite similar, allowing you to write the same patterns on both the client and server.

### Polling the `DbConnection`

In Rust, you now must explicitly poll your `DbConnection` to advance, where previously it ran automatically in the background. This provides a much greater degree of flexibility to choose your own async runtime and to work under the variety of exciting constraints imposed by game development - for example, you can now arrange it so that all your callbacks run on the main thread if you want to make GUI calls. You can recreate the previous behavior by calling `ctx.run_threaded()` immediately after buidling your connection. You can also call `ctx.run_async()`, or manually call `ctx.frame_tick()` at an appropriate interval.

In C# the existing API already required you explictly poll your `DbConnection`, so not much has changed there. The `Update()` method is now called `FrameTick()`.

### Subscribing to queries

We're planning a major overhaul of the API for subscribing to queries, but we're not quite there yet. This means that our subscription APIs are not yet as consistent as will soon be.

#### Rust

Subscribe to a set of queries by creating a subscription builder and calling `subscribe`.

```rust
ctx.subscription_builder()
    .on_applied(|ctx| { ... })
    .subscribe([
        "SELECT * FROM my_table",
        "SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE some_column = 123"
    ]);
```

The `on_applied` callback is optional. A temporarily limitation of this API is that you should add all your subscription queries at one time for any given connection.

#### C#

TODO

#### TypeScript

```ts
ctx.subscriptionBuilder()
    .onApplied(ctx => { ... })
    .subscribe([
        "SELECT * FROM my_table",
        "SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE some_column = 123"
    ]);
```

### Accessing tables

As in modules, all accesses to your connection's client cache now go through the `ctx.db`. Support for client-side indices is not yet consistent across all our SDKs, so for now you may find that you can't make some queries in clients which you could make in modules. The table handles also expose row callbacks.

### Observing and invoking reducers

Register reducer callbacks and request reducer invocations by going through `ctx.reducers`. You can also add functions to subscribe to reducer events that the server sends when a particular reducer is executed.

#### Rust

```rust
ctx.reducers.my_reducer(my_first_arg, my_second_arg, ...);

// Add a callback for each reducer event for `my_reducer`
let callback_id = ctx.reducers.on_my_reducer(|ctx, first_arg, second_arg, ...| {
    ...
});

// Unregister the callback
ctx.reducers.remove_my_reducer(callback_id);
```

#### C#

TODO

#### TypeScript

```ts
ctx.reducers.myReducer(myFirstArg, mySecondArg, ...);

// Add a callback for each reducer event for `my_reducer`
const callback = (ctx, firstArg, secondArg, ...) => {
    ...
};
ctx.reducers.onMyReducer(callback);

// Unregister the callback
ctx.reducers.removeMyReducer(callback);
```

### The event context

Most callbacks now take a first argument of type `&EventContext`. This is just like your `DbConnection`, but it has an additional field `event: Event`. `Event` is an enum, tagged union, or sum type which encodes all the different events the SDK can observe. This fills the same role as `ReducerEvent` used to, but `Event` is more specific and more accurate to what actually happened.

```rust
ctx.reducers.on_my_reducer(|ctx, first_arg, second_arg, ...| {
    match ctx.event {
        Reducer(reducer_event) => {
            ...
        },
        _ => unreachable!();
    }
});
```

#### C#

TODO

#### TypeScript

```ts
ctx.reducers.onMyReducer((ctx, firstArg, secondArg, ...) => {
    if (ctx.event.tag === 'Reducer') {
        const reducerEvent = ctx.event.value;
        ...
    }
});
```
