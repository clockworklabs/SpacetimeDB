## Server Database Modules

SpacetimeDB modules define your database schema and server-side business logic. Modules can be written in three languages:

- **[Rust](/databases)** - High performance, compiled to WebAssembly [(Quickstart)](/quickstarts/rust)
- **[C#](/databases)** - Great for Unity developers, compiled to WebAssembly [(Quickstart)](/quickstarts/c-sharp)
- **[TypeScript](/databases)** - Ideal for web developers, runs on V8 [(Quickstart)](/quickstarts/typescript)

## Client SDKs

**Clients** are applications that connect to SpacetimeDB databases. The `spacetime` CLI tool can automatically generate type-safe client code for your database.

- **[Rust](/sdks/rust)** - [(Quickstart)](/quickstarts/rust)
- **[C#](/sdks/c-sharp)** - [(Quickstart)](/quickstarts/c-sharp)
- **[TypeScript](/sdks/typescript)** - [(Quickstart)](/quickstarts/typescript)
- **[Unreal Engine](/sdks/unreal)** - C++ and Blueprint support [(Tutorial)](/tutorials/unreal/part-1)

### Unity

SpacetimeDB was designed first and foremost as the backend for multiplayer Unity games. The C# SDK integrates seamlessly with Unity projects. Learn more in the [SpacetimeDB Unity Tutorial](/tutorials/unity/part-1).
