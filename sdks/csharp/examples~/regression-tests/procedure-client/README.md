# C# SDK Procedure Test

Mirrored from regression-tests/client.

Currently separated from regression-tests as of 2025-11-14 the C# module bindings does not support procedures.
This relies on /modules/sdk-test-procedure as the server bindings, and is baked into the ../tools~/run-regression-tests.sh.
