# SpacetimeDB Unreal SDK

This folder contains the Unreal Engine plugin that allows games to talk to a SpacetimeDB server.  The design mirrors the official **Rust** SDK and borrows ideas from the **C#** SDK so that projects can share a common workflow across languages.

## Overview

The plugin exposes a high level API for establishing connections, invoking reducers and keeping a synchronized cache of database tables.  Communication happens over WebSockets using the BSATN binary format.  Most of the message and type headers are generated by the SpacetimeDB CLI so that Unreal games can send and receive the same structures as other SDKs.

## Feature Highlights

- Connect to a SpacetimeDB server and authenticate with identity tokens
- Call reducers and receive their results via Blueprint exposed delegates
- Subscribe to queries and maintain a local table cache updated by server diffs
- Serialize common Unreal types to BSATN, including arrays
- Auto-generated table types keep the API in sync with your database
- Pure C++ implementation with Blueprint wrappers for easy gameplay scripting

See the README files in each subfolder for more details on the available classes and helpers.

## Getting Started

1. Copy `SpacetimeDbSdk` into your project's `Plugins` directory or use the `AdditionalPluginDirectories` option described in `DEVELOP.md`.
2. Regenerate the headers under `Public/Types` by running the SpacetimeDB CLI against your module schema.
3. Include `SpacetimeDbSdk` in your game's build files and start a connection using `UDbConnectionBuilder`.

With the connection established you can call reducers, subscribe to queries and drive gameplay logic using incoming table data.
