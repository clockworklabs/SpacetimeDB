# Core bsatn library

These files here are being used by both the Unreal C++ Client SDK and the Module Library.
These files are noy the main files. The SDK do not use these files directly becouse a user might move the SDK plugin to the unreal engine plugin direcory or the unreal project directory.
Make all changed in the core library and copy them here.
