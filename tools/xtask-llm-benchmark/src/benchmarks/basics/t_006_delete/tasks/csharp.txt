Write a SpacetimeDB backend module in C# that defines one table and a reducer that deletes a row.
Use Accessor = "TableName" exactly as shown (e.g. User). Do not pluralize.

TABLE
- User
  - Struct: User
  - Fields:
    - Id: int (primary key)
    - Name: string
    - Age: int
    - Active: bool

REDUCERS
- DeleteUser: given id:int, delete the row in User with that Id
