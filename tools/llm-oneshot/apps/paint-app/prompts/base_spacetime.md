# SpacetimeDB Paint App - Base Prompt

Create me a **real-time collaborative paint/drawing app** using **SpacetimeDB as the backend**.

Project root is:

```
apps/paint-app/
```

Create the project under a **timestamped folder**:

```
apps/paint-app/spacetime/paint-app-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/
```

Use `paint-app` as the **module name** for SpacetimeDB.

## Constraints

- Work **entirely inside** your timestamped folder. Do not touch any other existing code.
- Only create/modify code under:
  - `apps/paint-app/spacetime/paint-app-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/backend/spacetimedb/` (server-side TypeScript)
  - `apps/paint-app/spacetime/paint-app-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/client/src/` (client-side TypeScript/React)
- Keep it minimal and readable.

## UI Requirements

Use SpacetimeDB brand styling (dark theme).
