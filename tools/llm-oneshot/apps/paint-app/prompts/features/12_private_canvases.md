### Sharing & Private Canvases

- Canvases are private by default (only creator can access)
- Generate a share link that allows others to join
- Set link permissions: "Anyone with link can view" or "Anyone with link can edit"
- Invite specific users by username (they see it in their canvas list)
- Revoke share link (generates new one, old link stops working)
- Canvas list shows "Private", "Shared", or collaborator avatars
