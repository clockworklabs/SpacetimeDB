### Basic Drawing

* Users can set a display name and pick an avatar color
* Users can create canvases and join/leave them
* Basic drawing tools: freehand brush, eraser (visually removes strokes), color picker
* Adjustable brush size
* Clear canvas option (with confirmation)
* Real-time sync - see other users' strokes appear as they draw
* Strokes should remain visible during drawing (no flicker from polling)
