### Permissions

* Canvas creator is the owner
* Owner can set collaborator roles: **viewer** (can only watch) or **editor** (can draw)
* Role changes take effect **instantly** - if you're demoted to viewer mid-stroke, it cancels
* Owner can remove users from the canvas (they're kicked immediately)
* Viewers see a "View Only" badge and all tools are disabled
* Editors can't change permissions or remove others
